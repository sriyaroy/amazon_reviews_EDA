I have to put socks on for at least a half hour after I rub it into my feet though, as that's about how long it takes to penetrate ( and I don't want to stain my couch by putting my feet up too soon.. )And as an extra bonus, it's really done wonders for my hands by just doing my feet.I highly recommend this for dry cracked feet!"

Just what I expected. A friend of mine let me borrow this product, and I was instantly impressed. Glad I purchased one for myself.The width and shape of the iron makes for a more loose, natural look. Since being pregnant, I've lost a bit of my natural curls and this iron creates a curl similar to my lost locks. I have never been able to use a straightener to properly curl my hair, but this product is as close to the straightener-curl-look as possible. It curls quickly and efficiently. It stays with a bit of hair spray (post-curl) or hot spray (pre-curl). It does get very hot, but it comes with a glove to protect your hand. To me, the glove is a bit cumbersome, so I don't use it. Consequently, I burn myself a lot. That's more of a reflection of the user than the product, though. I suggest using the glove if you are accident-prone like myself. Overall, I highly recommend this product to someone who is looking for thicker, looser, more natural curls"

My embarrassingly yellow teeth are now: ivory white.  The color of the whites of my eyes.  I am very happy with the results.I researched several .edu sites and learned that the active ingredients in whiteners used by dentists are exactly used by all the Crest whitestrips: peroxide.  (Some dentists also use one other alternative ingredient or both together.)  These sites warned that the active ingredient should not be more than 12% by volume.  Crest, on the phone, confirmed that their strongest formula does not exceed 11%.I chose this formula because I was leery of the ""sensitivity"" of the strongest Crest whitestrip formula.  ""Sensitiviity"" means pain.  This formula, and one other were Crest's second-strongest.  They contain the superior adhesive.My reading confirmed that peroxide does NOT harm enamel, and the ""senstivity"" it causes is temporary and harmless.  (By the way, these .edu sites confirmed that whitening toothpastes DO harm enamel.)I followed suggestions on Amazon and elsewhere.  I had my teeth professional cleaned before I began.  Then waited 2 weeks.  I followed the package directions scrupulously, EXCEPT - I kept the strips on for an hour (rather than 30 minutes).  As the strongest formulas required one hour -- I figured this was safe.The strips are easy to place, wear, and remove.  They were barely apparent, and barely affected my speech.  There was minimal ""sensitivity"" for me.  The strips do NOT extend to the back teeth, but I am nevertheless happy with the overall results.  (But Crest, yes, I would prefer to include my back teeth.)The instructions say one can repeat the process twice a year.  I will.  My dentist would have charged $500.  Crest, thanks"

Just a bit about my skin type and hair type because lets face it everyone is different and will experience this product in their own way.  I have sensitive thin skin and black course hair on my chin yet more soft hair on the sides.  I use to break out in rashes easily so it was important for me to make sure the blades are always sharp and I shave with one stroke. This razor was provided through a program by Gillette and when it arrived I was excited to take it for a test drive and this is what I thought...The Looks:This handle design is by far the coolest.  With base being chrome, blue trim highlights,  black rubberized grip and on button that lights up when the unit is on. It also comes with a holder that's well thought out.  At first I did not notice, but this thing can stand up right as well as flat down. Great for medicine cabinets that have little room or bathroom counters that need all the retail space.  An added feature is that when you are done and the unit is still wet the water does not fall forward but slides down to the bottom of the handle where the holder has a lip and scope that directs the water back or collects in the scoop.  Great if you want to keep water marks off the counter.The Feel:I have average hands enough to just hold a basketball with one hand and slim fingers.  If the handle is too skinny it does not work for me so I needed a handle that will be able to stick to my hand when shaving the harder areas like the jaw line. The sides are ribbed and feel sold.  There is also more rubber on the underside so when you curl your fingers around the handle you got grip!.  They even have rubber grip at the very bottom of the handle where batteries go, great for the last pinky finger as it curls the base.  Basically the stickiest handle without looking all rubberized!The Shave:So I've tried this with different lengths of hair from very small bristle (5 O'clock shadows) to very long borderline having to trim first (7mm hair length). In all cases this baby was able to give me a clean shave with no rashes or tugs.  The longest hair did take longer but the vibrations of the blades allowed it to glide with ease. When I went to wash the hair off the blades there no clogging! This makes it quicker to shave if you have to rush off to work. Getting the sideburns cut straight was a breeze. You also have precision blade that can clean up the line after you use the flat side.  The sound of the vibrations were a bit louder from the older versions but nothing close to the sound of any electric shavers.  I guess with louder vibrations you also get stronger vibrations, able to handle when pressing down on your skin.  Overall I get an excellent shave without worrying about nicks or rashes.The Con:The only thing I could say about this unit is the on/off button that lights up when in use would drain the battery faster than not having it on.  It's great that the light flashes when the batteries are low but why have the light on the whole time while you shave? it's not like you can see the button while shaving. I think a better use would be when you turn on the unit if the lights flash then that's when you need to change the batteries.Overall:Excellent handling, well thought out, and my new favorite!  I would highly recommend this shaver!"

It sits back on its laurels and outsources to China.    First off, the electric shaver it was replacing was a Japanese \\""national\\"" brand battery operated single rotary head shaver that was smaller than the palm of your hand, yet lasted over twenty years of daily use, including travel, camping, a good many drops, and a couple of accidental submersions.  Purchased in Japan back in 1987, it always shaved close, never nicked or irritated, did its job in under two minutes, and cost less than $20 (adjusted Yen to Dollar).    Now to Braun's cruZer Z-50; reputable Braun name, rechargeable foil shaver with loads of gadgets for sideburn / beard grooming, all for under $50.  A bit pricey, but seemed like it would make a fine replacement shaver.    Wrong!  After charging it up, as per the instructions, I tried shaving the one day old growth and didn't notice any difference.  I still had all the same stubble stuck to my face instead the shaver.  Blade to the rescue while reviewing the instructions at work to try and figure out if I did anything wrong.  Next morning disassembled / reassembled the shaver to check that it was working properly and wound up with the same results.  Over the course of the following couple weeks, I tried hot wet electric shaving, electric shaving with creams and gels, spending ten freakin' minutes doing a two minute job, combining all of the above - all with the same dismally disappointing results, but with varying levels of rash streaks on my cheeks and neck - and still having to go back over with a blade razor daily.    In the end, I was donated (Yes, DONATED by a work colleague) a 2nd hand, \\""2nd rate\\"" Norelco rotory.  The Norelco works, the Braun does not, and I can not replace my old national that bit the dust.  I will not speak of Braun's more expensive model shavers as I have a friend who speak well of his, but as for my future backing of Braun products, I think I'll stick to their Formula1 race cars and skip on their shavers"

I bought it after getting this kit because I liked everything in it so much, but the smell of the lotion beat me and I stopped using it. If you sweat it reactivates the smell, not a fun learning experience. The face stuff is fantastic though. I ended up buying the radiance serum and the advanced age line which I also adore. The face wash is a must have I bought the full size as soon as I could. You can't go wrong with the kit you get just enough product to decide if it's for you! Plus the full size products will last forever so if you do decide to go with this line though a bit pricy (not as bad as other lines) it well worth it since it lasts and a little goes a long way"

Most importantly, the body wash did not bother my sensitive skin.  I am a pale redhead who is allergic to pretty much everything.  I had no irritation, burning, redness, or rash.  The smell is pleasant and not overwhelming, thus causing me to sneeze like other body washes do.Overall I highly recommend this caress body wash"

When I got them, the brushes were all in great condition and nicely packed in a folding carrying case. Each individual brush and dotting tool has a separate slot. They look to be comparable quality to other nail brushes I've purchased on Amazon. I wanted to try them out and I was able to do several interesting designs with the variety of tools. Please keep in mind I have not done much by way of designs, I usually put some glitter or small nail stickers in my acrylics but I haven't done much with painting. I was able to do several different things and I thought they turned out pretty decent for my first try. If you do acrylics you could use these square-tipped brushes to push the different acrylic colors around for tips or designs but probably not the best brushes for applying a whole acrylic nail. This set is definitely a nice thing to have if you are interested in doing your own nail designs! I recommend you practice on some paper or unused acrylic nails first"

My hair was shiny, silky, and it felt moisturized. So nice.The trick is to apply this the night before you wash. I know the jar says only leave it on for 5-10 minutes but I like to rub this into my hair, brush, tie it into a bun and let the masque harden. Your hair will feel waxy at first, but once you rinse and blow dry you'll notice the difference.If you have coarse, straight, dry hair - get this. I also recommend this for ladies who perm or relax their hair as a deep conditioner...it'll seal the bonds in your hair and soothe your scalp. I wouldn't use this on oily or fine hair - the Shea can be fatty, and hard to wash out.The fragrance is addictive, too"

I think I'll still opt for slow and careful combing most of the time,(which is combing long hair in small sections,starting at the bottom rather than the top,and working your way up as you comb out the tangles so when you finally reach the hair at your part,and comb down to the ends,all of the tangles have already been removed,so your hair doesn't break or pull or become damaged). But The Wet Brush does do a good job of taking out tangles quickly,without being damaging and I do like it. The real fault may be that some of my hair is less healthy than most of it. And those are the parts that are left wispy looking after brushing. So maybe my hair really deserves 3 or 4 stars and the brush deserves five. I'm sure if I used The Wet Brush and brushed in a nice vegan leave-in conditioner or conditioning detangler like Original Sprout,the wispy and flyaway ends would be gone.Still glad I bought this and I will be using it"

Ebay, who is in Australia, already has made a big impact, and if Amazon comes I think they will take over. Just be aware when buying electrical products from USA is that the voltage is different, but this shaver has a 100-240 volt rating so it works fine; you just have to use a adaptor plug (about $2). I saved about 50% compared to shops in Aus, and about 30% compared to Ebay.

I have tried Nair and Veet and neither worked for me.  This sounded like a good idea because you don't have to grow you leg hair to mammoth length like with waxing.    I got this about 3 months before I was getting married, so I could have a shave-free honeymoon.  I knew it would hurt at first when I used it, but I had no idea how much!  Ouch, good thing after about the second time using it there was much less pain.  It didn't work as well as I'd hoped though.  It took me about 45 mintues to do both legs from knee to ankles.  (very hard to use on knees.) I had to take breaks about every twenty minutes because the machine gets very warm and makes using it uncomfortable.  I have blonde hair, so it's a mix of course and fine hair on my legs.  Unfortunately, it only pulled out the course hairs.  The finer hairs were broken off and grew back in a few days.  NO WAY could this be used on my bikini zone, but the trimmer works great for that, trimming it down really close, which is good enough for me.  I also used a sugar scrub to exfoliate and get rid of all the ingrown hairs it produced.  I have to say, it was too much effort for very little pay-off.  I had to use the machine every week, and the finer hairs still grew back in between usages.  I went back to shaving, much less time and completely pain free.  I think I will still use the trimmer in the summer for my bikini zone because it leaves no razor burn, but I won't use the epilator part again.  I gave a 3 star review because I think it would work better for people with darker, courser hair, and the pain lessens with each use"

Great Product.,"Over the years, I've tried various Nivea, Shea Moisture, Bump Patrol, and other products from the big box/pharmacy stores. Eventually, went online trying more pricey products from SpaGlo and Geo F Trumper (Coral Skin Food).  Learned that for me, 3 ingredients seem to be the key (in order of importance):  1) Tea Tree Oil, 2) Aloe Vera, and 3) No Alcohol (eliminating the burn).  Looking for this combination online led to this High Time product.  Although the menthol soothes my skin, it does give it sort of a medicine smell, but I don't notice after it dries and it dries quick - one could always add cologne. Having used creams before, had to adjust to this liquid, but being a liquid helps it go a long way. I apply before shaving and afterwards. For me, no residue, no discoloration on my collar shirts (unlike previous creams), and so far, best results for No Bumps!  Haven't looked for anything else since finding this. Thank You High Time!"

It's not like gel, which is slippery, but not heavy like lotion- just perfectly in between.

When I apply gel or a styling lotion, my hair looks long and curly but about a few hours later, it shrinks and becomes poofy. I hate that a lot! But what I noticed when I applied this and after a couple hours, my hair was the same as I left it and I love it! Usually when I am wearing gel in my hair, my curls harden and stiffen. But with this, my curls remained soft and bouncy. This hair lotion has a light scent to it and it keeps my hair smelling nice- and I even got a compliment on it!

The two-step process sounded a little gimmicky, but truth be told I like gimmicky tooth care products as long as the price is right.  Fancy dispensers, extra stripes, mouthwash crystals, I enjoy it all.And while I might not have been expecting a huge leap forward, this is probably the most powerful toothpaste I've ever used.  After brushing, my mouth feels very fresh and remains that way right up until my next meal, which is something I couldn't say about previous products I've used.  It really does feel similar to a dental cleaning minus the discomfort.Regarding the whitening claims, before I started using the product I had noticed some mild yellowing along the bottom row.  I felt that the product cleared that up fairly quickly, within a couple of days of use.  I haven't stopped using this product yet, so I can't say whether or not this is a temporary effect, i.e. contingent on continued use or if my teeth will remain white if I switch to a non-whitening toothpaste.The two-step part was nice in that it keeps me focused on the duration of my brushing and a proper rinsing procedure.  The downside is, due to the product size, the product goes quickly.  Being about 2/3 through the product, I would guess that I will get about 100 brushings in total. This might help you judge value if you choose to purchase this Crest product yourself"

It was also slightly painful going over the front of my legs. To make matters worse, the hair growth came back quicker than it usually does, probably due to not getting a close enough shave.

Most (if not all) required extreme attention in order to get even color, no streaks or patches and a natural look...and even with the most careful application I still ended up with some patchy, streaky unnatural color. Most were full of chemicals and the color came on very noticeably and not in a natural way!! I have been going to a salon for the past couple of years and getting the mystic tan. The color was nice after it settled but seriously didn't last more than a 3-4 days before the unattractive and uneven fading. The first day after tanning the color was too much and I preferred day 2, but then it was time to go in again in a day or two. Besides that, you're being sprayed with and breathing in all those chemicals! Creepy!! Not to mention the outrageous cost...probably well over $600 per year.  Way too much maintenance! So, I decided to try a different product at home. I am pretty light with olive tones naturally and really look a lot better with a little lift in color. This product has made me very happy. It's winter so I don't want a ton of color but one application gave me just the lift I was looking for! Not only did it go on very smooth, it is tinted so I could see where I had gone. I applied to freshly cleansed and exfoliated, dry skin. I applied to legs first to get a feel for it. I had instant color and it looked very natural on me. It has a lovely almond fragrance which I enjoy and, despite what I read in another review, it DOES NOT give that funky, tanning spray smell after the initial fragrance wears off. I let it dry for maybe 10 minutes before dressing and did not shower till the next day. The color did stay and I have not seen any transfer on my clothes or my sheets. I have been mixing a bit in my face cream in between full body applications (face always fades faster) and I have been extremely happy with the results. Never a streak, natural color, easy to apply, nice fragrance. I will say, NOT ULTRA DARK. I'm sure it's buildable though I just haven't tried that yet since I like the result of one application for the winter months. I am not the fairest of complexions and it may show more on a very fair skinned person. I am so very happy to have found a replacement for the expensive, full of chemicals, pain in the butt spray tans and will absolutely continue to use this product!"

I needed this because I am so conscious about retaining moisture that I never use clarifying products, for fear of drying my hair out.

My hair had the tendency to look greasy after one day of not washing, but with this shampoo/ conditioner, I can go three days without washing it before it looks bad. If you have fine or dry hair, you need to leave the shampoo in for a full minute, and you need to use the conditioner and leave it in for the full 2 minutes (and comb your hair while the conditioner is in it--that helps).

I bought this on a whim, and only a few weeks later my teeth are noticeably cleaner and feel great. I can easily and conveniently floss all of my teeth in around one minute.It's a little noisy but not bad. It's quieter than most bathroom exhaust fans. With the bathroom door shut you won't disturb anyone's sleep.The first few days that I had it I used the different attachments, but now I only use the standard one since it seems to do everything effectively. A full tank of lukewarm tap water allows me to get all of my teeth from the front and the back at least one time.Conclusion; even if you vigilantly floss every day the traditional way, you probably don't do as good of a job as this machine does. Plus this thing makes flossing incredibly quick and low-effort. For the health benefit this gives you, $50 or so is an absolute bargain"

I have UD, Max, Benifit, The Balm, Ben Nye, and half a dozen other brands in my case.  This is the pallete I reach for OVER my 4 UD palletts.  It has a nice selection of eyeshadows similar to the Naked 1 and 2 pallette.  I like these better because I find they wear and blend well and the shimmery shades have a great payoff but without the chunky glitter that can irritate my eyes like the UD brands can.  They shadows go on buttery and with a good primer I have actually fallen asleep with shadow on and woke up with it still in place (I do not recommend this it was a very late night).  The picture does not do this pallette justice it really truly deserves. I took off one star for the packaging not having a mirror!  The case is slim enough for travel and I travel with this pallette all the time as it can give a great all around day, or night, casual, or formal look.  For this price you can not really pass it up.  Better yet sign up for the costal scents newsletters and pick this and pick up the 2nd one too (my favorite all time pallette) when they are on a 50% off sale.  A little heads up do not buy the 88,120, and higher pallets.  They are all premade and are not as good as the revealed pallets or the other pallettes made from the costal scents hot pots.  Thease also have a gew nice mattes in each pallette.  The mattes are about the same quality and consistancy as UD.  What can I say mattes by their nature are just a little chalky.  Good luck and I sincerely hope you buy and love this pallette the way I do!"

You have to get this steamer fairly close to the clients face in order for them to feel the steam so having it drip was too much for me.

I love all my product lines, but the bottom line is that my hair needs things to change up to stay happy.  Definitely worth at least at week of your time to see how your responds"

The adjustments are different than the traditional clip on  1,2,3 guards.  I think I went a bit too short first go, but it all grows back, so no real harm.I would say the only negative is knowing what length you are cutting at, as it is a bit fluid with the settings.

Try a small amount first and see if your skin can tolerate it. Mine couldn't. I had to remove it after 5 minutes, but that is not to say it won't work for you; I am a redhead with very sensitive skin. The smell was not as offensive as some products. But what a mess it makes! The label instructions are unclear, saying only that the product should be kept away from bath items to avoid being slippery. It says to use in the tub, but one has to assume this means without the water running-and that is indeed what it means, to avoid washing it off before the product has had time to work. Caution: This product has ""horrible"" overspray. Spray goes everywhere! Not only is this wasteful, we have an antique procelain tub installed in 1952. The foam plastered onto the sides of the tub. I couldn't rinse it off because that would have washed the foam off my legs. So I wiped it off. The film left a tough orangish stain all over my porcelain tub and a wooden under-sink cabinet. I have used a paint scraper and an industrial-grade flammable gunk/paint remover and have yet to get all this stuff off my tub and cabinet. It activates super fast, and before I knew it, the foam was cooked onto the procelain of the tub. Proceed with extreme caution with this product! I feel like Church @ Dwight Co.

But I have combination skin with a tendency to break out. As such, I usually pick gel cleansers which are more suited for oilier skin.  Usually creamy cleansers aren't my best bet. However, recently I have stepped up my game on prescription medications. A few weeks ago I increased the strength of my Retin-A Micro. Gel cleansers are now too drying for me.As I  ease into my new Retin-A regimen, the hunt for a calming and moisturizing cleanser begins.  Normally, when my skin is on the dry side, I switch to my beloved Shiseido purifying cleansing foam or Philosophy Purity One -Step Cleanser.  I absolutely love the creamy and foaming texture of my Shiseido cleanser. But even that is a bit too drying fir me right now. I also love the creamy feeling of the Philosophy cleanser but I wish it was more foaming.  What's a girl to do? Enter,  Lancome Creme Mousse Comforting Foaming Cleanser. It's the perfect blend of all the other cleansers I love and doesn't irritate my extremely sensitive skin that is adjusting to this new level of Retin-A.  I am in love with this cleanser and I cannot live without it.My skin usually feels tight after washing my face, even when I am not using prescription products. But my skin is also oily . A lovely mix isn't it? If you have combination skin, your skin is very sensitive or very dry, this cleanser may be for you.  I think this cleanser has the perfect amount of everything to balance out all the forces at work. While expensive for a cleanser, a little goes a long way. The creamy cleanser glides on your skin, foams nicely and takes all of your makeup off. All of this and its extremely gently at the same time.I was recently stocking up on Clarins Vital Light cream and we were discussing cleanseers and the sales lady at Saks told me this is her all time favorite cleanser too. Once you try it you will be hooked.For more reviews check out pimples and wrinkles.

It does not remove much hair and its gunk that acts as a glue is nearly useless and very difficult to remove from the skin.    My situation: The first night I bought this stuff I gave it a trial using it on my shoulders.  It worked OK, with several hairs left but not too bad for a cheap product.  The next day I tried it on my back.  On those thicker patches of hairs it does about nothing.  I'm following this product's directions completely and removing the pads quickly, but to no avail.  After applying it to several areas and the pads hardly doing anything I just gave up.  On top of this, the gunk on these pads does not come off easily.  The previous night I used the included towelette with its gunk-removing ingredients and this day I used the last one.  That's right, it comes with two; you better figure that in to your day.  I tried soap and water and alcohol to get the gunk off and it does not fully get the stuff off.  And you'll definitely want to get it off.    So, basically, there are others things to try out there.

When my hair-coloring journey began, I got Manic Panic Voodoo Blue hair dye. Since I didn't want to damage my hair forever until I cut it off, I decided not to bleach it. My hair is a medium blonde, about a shade of 7 or so. I dyed my hair and it turned out a turquoise blue which I loved, but wasn't the color of the bottle. When it faded, it faded into green because of my natural yellow pigment.So I then redyed more of that same blue over the green, but it color-blended to a shade of dark blue-green. About after 3 months, the dark blue-green faded to green, and I didn't like it, plus I wanted to dye it purple. I started looking into products that get hair dye out of hair without bleaching. Most of the products were for people who had gone from blonde to a dark color that didn't turn out well, and for your whole head, but I just needed something that gets unnatural colors out of the ends of hair, and the green wasn't a ton darker than my natural shade.First, I started with crushed Vitamin C tablets and dandruff shampoo, several times. Didn't do anything. Then I tried baking soda and dandruff shampoo. Didn't do anything. Then I heard about Color Zap, but the reviews said it damaged hair, so that was a no-go.Finally, I found a product called Color Oops, and the situation turned from seemingly hopeless to entirely possible. So I bought it, but then I read a label on the side: DOES NOT WORK ON UNNATURAL COLORS, LIKE BLUES, GREENS, ETC. OR GOING FROM LIGHT HAIR TO DARK. My heart sank, but I though to try it anyway because, hey, what if it worked?I comb my hair well, and apply it. Now, I've read reviews that say the smell absolutely sucks, but that's not entirely true, at least in my case. When I first put it on, it almost smelled a bit like citrus, but then after letting it sit, it did smell kinda gross and like rotten eggs. When I washed it off, the green had gone away dramatically! IT WAS AMAZING AND I WAS SOO HAPPY!!So, I rinsed it out and it looked soooo much better, but there was still green left. I wanted it all out, so I waited for my hair to dry and repeated the process. That second time, the green was pretty much gone, accept for a light tint because my hair is permanently stained now, since it's such a light color. But the green was finally gone!After much rejoicing, and a lot of conditioner, I waited for my hair to dry for about 4 or 5 hours. Then I dyed my hair Manic Panic Ultra Violet Purple, and the little green tint didn't effect the color. It turned out beautiful! So now my hair is an amazing shade of purple that I didn't need bleach for, and my hair isn't damaged.As for the smell, it wasn't that big of a problem. Yes, it smelled bad, but only when I put the hair against my nose did I actually smell it.Good luck to all of you during your hair journey!"

They both peeled the first day and I was annoyed at the huge price, for very little wear time.I was doubtful about trying yet another gel system that did not require a light, but purchased a set with a pretty pink and the top coat for $15, not too bad.

Somehow in the busyness of having two young kids, I didn't notice he'd picked up the habit of chewing them as a toddler. I glanced down thinking it was about time to cut his nails, and he didn't have any. That was six years ago, and we've tried everything -- alternate chew options, gum, painting his nails with other stuff. Nothing worked. He doesn't bite from stress or anxiety -- it's merely a habit when he's bored or intensely focused.  We've now been using Mavala for about three weeks, and he has nail growth on all his fingers. Occasionally when it's worn off a bit (maybe after 4-5 days), he'll catch himself starting to chew, and then we put on another coat.Bear in mind that this was NOT pleasant. He's highly sensitive to tastes, and so when we first put it on, he cried and howled and swore he'd never let us do it again.  But then when he couldn't/wouldn't bite the nails, he started to see it as a challenge. Then he came to show me the white growth, and he is SO proud that he now lets us put it on without a fuss.We turned to this as a last resort because he's going to need early orthodontia, but his orthodontist told us that she wouldn't put anything on his teeth until he stopped biting his nails because that could undermine the quality of the braces. So we had no choice -- he had to stop biting.I very rarely write reviews on Amazon because I don't usually have much to say. But I am thrilled with the results of this"

For reference, I'm quite pale with warm undertones and medium pigmented lips.Let me start by saying that the color Honey is a perfect mid-toned mauvey pink. It leans a teeny bit to the coral side once I've applied it. It is a beautiful color that looks natural and I find that it would be very versatile with just about any makeup look and any skin tone. The packaging is nice- I like that it twists up rather than having to sharpen it. The chubby pencil look is adorable as well :)Here's Revlon's claim to fame for this product: ""Its a pampering balm fused with a lightweight lipstain in an adorable chubby crayon. Just Bitten Kissable Balm Stain gives softer, smoother lips with a perfect flush of color that lasts hour after hour.""Pampering? Eh, maybe. It has a delicious mint feeling that feels nice on the lips when first applied but instantly disappears.Softer, smoother lips? No. I exfoliated before applying this product and I felt like I had to press hard to get color to show up and then it felt a little like...moist chalk. It settled into the very few lines I have on my lips and made them look dry. Applying a balm or chapstick before this is necessary if you want your lips to look smooth and soft.Lasts hour after hour? I can say, with confidence, that this does last quite a while. I've worn it to work several times and I can always detect a faint flush of this when I get home 9 hours after first applying it.For around $9 at my local grocery store, this is quite steep when the claims Revlon makes aren't exactly accurate, at least not in my case. I love the color and the packaging is adorable but I'm sure that there are other products that are more moisturizing at a better price"

Blocks out all light and even muffles noise because the cloth fits comfortably over your ears. I do my fair share of tossing and turning and the mask stays put without having to make it overly tight.Another positive point is that the fabric is very cooling. I awake during the night, overly warm, but have discovered that when I have this sleep mask on, my face seems to remain cool.Also, for some reason, I am able to fall right back into a deep sleep when using this mask. No more sleep deprivation! Such is the curse of the middle-aged woman.I highly recommend The Sleep Master mask. I have wasted money on other, less expensive, poorly made masks.

I can't find a reason why this product should even be usedCons:Has a distinct unmasked odor of a sage bush, not pleasant but tolerable.Does not alleviate dandruff, actually it made my dandruff and itch significantly worse than when I didn't use anti-dandruff shampoos.Left my hair feeling ""raw"", stiff and lacking moisture and natural oils. This is the first time I felt the need to actually use conditioner.Tea Tree:Hair felt significantly better when compared to the SAGE shampoo, but still did not even remotely help alleviate my dandruff.If you have medium to severe dandruff like I do and many of the other 1-star reviews here, use products with pyrithione zinc, seems to be the only thing that actually works and is proven to work.

The Andis 38300 High Heat Press Comb is a great hot comb. With previous hot combs that I've bought, I had to put the temp on the highest setting to get any kind of heat. And I found this odd and frustrating since hot combs are used primarily by African-American women and our hair is coarser and requires higher heat. So because of past experience, I immediately put the setting on 20 (highest setting)when I started using the Andis 38300. I soon found out there was no need to set it that high. The hot comb was super hot and I nearly burned my scalp. It did a great job of straightening and smoothing my edges (which is what I mainly use the hot comb for). I did need to use a little oil along with the hot comb to completely get rid of the frizz. The next time I used it, I had the setting on 5 and it did an excellent job of smoothing my hair without burning my scalp.The Andis 38300 is definitely one of the better electric hot combs that I have used. Definitely recommend"

For the price you can't beat them.  There are a couple things that you need to be aware of though in order to be completely satisified.  As with anything you do pay for what you get (generally)..so be prepared to put just a little effort in.  Here are the things I had to do to be completely satisfied and probably won't buy any  other extensions because for the money these can't be beat.1. If you have average hair in weight and thickness you will want to buy two sets if you want to add length. If you have extra thick hair you may need three but two may work..2. Buy 2\\"" longer than you really want and then cut them.  You usually need to cut them anyways to get them to blend well with your hair that way they are thicker on the ends unless you have very very fine hair and/or just want wispy ends.3. As soon as you get them remove all the clips and buy some clear, permenent fabric adhesive and run a bead of fabric adhesive along the very top from the stitches up.  Then use the tip of your bottle to lightly tap the glue into the hair (basically working into the center). Once it is dry flip it over and do the same for the other side (usually after about 20 min you can flip it over and do the other side).4. take matching weft sizes and match them up and sew them together from the back with the back one just slightly below the top one so it doesn't add too much bulk along the top. I also so my 2 clip size to the end of a 3 clip size for around the bigger part of my head so one peice will go all the way around from one side too the next side.  That way I have less clips and peices to have to worry about. If you have fine or thin hair leave a few peices single layered for if you want to put some clips closer to the top of your head so it is thinner and less likely to be seen.5. Sew Clips back on on fasten down snuggley (use at least the top and middle holes on the clips to fasten down).6. Oil them down with JOJOBA oil and she butter once a week and let them sit for an hour or so then wash with a moisuriziong shampoo and conditioner.  I then put extension spray on mine that i buy from sally beauty that does have a silicone base to keep them tagle free. ( I actually have pure cyclo-dimthecone that I use to coat them with silicone.  However if you use this you need to wash them let them paritally dry, then put on the oils, let them sit and then wash and condition them again)  Silicone products keep them tangle free but do not allow the oils to penetrate good when you oil them so you have to take an extra step if you use silicone.If you need to color them I would color them before you sew them together for more even coloring along the top where it is overlapping and thicker.  I actually don't even use all the wefts when I sew them together like this.  My hair is a little fine and average thickness.  I have a 3 clip sewn together weft left over as well as two 2 clip wefts"

I had stumbled upon this Three Kings Pontifical blend in a religious shop in Rome a few blocks from the Vatican and they advised me on buying this particular incense precisely for the same reason.  After being at St. Peter's Basilica many times during incense burning, I can indeed attest that the aroma is identical.  This incense will definitely set a reverent spiritual atmosphere, and will leave a very pleasant after-smell lingering on for at least a couple of hours, if not well into the next day, depending on the building structure.My only advice is to make sure you don't leave the individual resins burning too long or else they might produce an \\""overburn\\"" smell...or you could just leave it like that, depending on individual taste.Whether to burn at home, or to buy for your local parish, I strongly recommend Three Kings Pontifical blend.  It may carry a steep price, but if you're planning on using it for occasional burning at home, then it will last you a very long time.

The small bottles and containers that form this set are really very nice -- but the plastic bag in which they come has an extremely flimsy sliding zipper on it. The thing popped loose from its track the third time I used it, and it cannot be forced back onto that track, so now I have a bag that cannot be closed. Given the price tag, that's rather disappointing.UPDATE: When I reported the facts above directly to Blasani, they very kindly replaced the entire kit for me -- and while the bag is no different from before, and still has the same flimsy zipper, it is also a replacement entirely at their cost -- so I'm bumping my review upward by two stars. The zipper may be flimsy, but at least the customer service is solid. :"

With the Olay Venus razor blades one swipe in each leg suffices and leaves my skin as smooth as a baby's bottom. I have used this in my bikini area with no issues as well. But I have to be honest, there is one negative aspect to it - the moisture bars become noticeably smaller after the 3rd or 4th use. When the moisture bars are smaller - it no longer touches your skin. I also had the incident where the moisture bar just completely fell off my razor. Overall the pros do outweigh the cons.

It is light in weight, feels balanced in the hand, and has soft-touch plastic underneath for a sure grip.  The integrated comb is easy to adjust and doesn't get lost.It does a good job of trimming hair on the head or on the body.  The comb is hard plastic but seems sturdy enough and the cut is even.It can be rinsed under the faucet which is very handy since clippers pick up debris, especially in crevices.  The sealed, washable models cost more than others.  I recommend using an old toothbrush rather than the little cleaning brush that is included.There is an intermittent flashing indicator on the power button when charging.The design is attractive and streamlined and the blue accents on the black body are very modern and masculine.The motor is quite a bit louder and higher-pitched than the other clippers I have tested and the teeth are larger so it doesn't work so well without the comb for close clipping.

This Fiber Gum is perfect, creates great shape and texture that lasts (note: I live in a dry climate).  It darkens my blond hair a bit, which brings out the grays, makes them look silvery and shiny by contrast.  I use a little hair oil first for shine (Moroccan Oil or Agadir Oil), then use the Fiber Gum to create choppy waves on top, slicked sides, and pointy little bangs and sideburns.  Yes, it dries a little hard, but once dry I just run my fingers through it lightly to break it up a little for the wet-dry effect,and it still holds, add a little back in here and there for extra definition if I need it.

You only need a drop or two at the most! No matter what you are using your Argan Oil for, less is more!  It also makes this is an amazing value.Starting with being a great face moisturizer.  Starting with a clean, dry face; place a couple drops of Argan oil in the palm of your hand and pat the oil all over your face. This is an AWESOME moisturizer, it absorbs fast, without being greasy in the least!!!Use Pure Argan Oil as your serum if you want, wait a minute or two, then add your moisturizer. Although I have been using my argon oil as my only my moisturizer and I love it!! I love the feel and the results!Conditioner for your hair. While your hair is wet add a FEW drops of Argan Oil and massage into your hair, through to the ends and scalp. This is a great tip for those that abuse their hair. ummm like ME!! A drop or two, on dry hair for incredibly shiny hair!!  Without looking greasy. You can also use a single drop on dry hair starting at the ends of your hair and working your way up. This help your dry hair look soft, vibrant and healthy!DO NOT use too much!! Thats my most important tip! A small amount goes really far. Too much and you will have a greasy look, or greasy looking hair. No one wants that!This can be used on your cuticles! Stretch marks and of course my favorite! Fine lines and wrinkles!

They said it was fine once I put everything else on, but upon initial application it seemed super light. It also goes on pretty thick, so that contributed to the unnatural look.

This is by far the best idea for anyone getting into DE shaving.  Everyone's face is different and the only way to find out the best combo for your face and razor is to buy a sampler pack like this.Astra - Tried these first based on forums and a friend's recommendation as a good starter blade.  This was not a winner for my face/razor.  By the end of the first shave, it started tugging a little and trying it a second shave was bad news bears for my mug.  Perhaps it was inexperience as I was learning, but I can't forget the bad memories.Derby & Shark - Similar experience to the Astra with an OK (but not super close) first shave, but bad bad irritation/bumps/ingrown hairs with any subsequent shaves.Gillette 7 o'clock - These blades worked pretty well with a nice close first shave and a perfectly acceptable 2nd shave.  The third shave was not as good, but depending on exactly how long between shaves (24 vs 36 vs 48), sometimes the third shave was fine too.  I used a couple of these blades and thought they would be my go-to blade for a while.Feather - Once I started using these, I didn't even go on with testing the others.  (Although from other reviews, maybe I should try the bluebirds).  These were far and away the best blades for me.  Unfortunately they're also the most expensive (but still way cheaper than cartridges).  I could consistently get 3 shaves from each blade without my face and neck looking like I was back in high school with acne.  After using a couple blades, I was sold and bought a bulk pack which I use as my everyday blade now.I still have the remaining blades and perhaps I'll revisit them if I'm feeling adventurous or I run out of my Feathers.  But for anyone starting out with DE shaving, do yourself a favor and buy a sampler pack.Although your face may dislike you for a time and you may look like you got in a fight with a badger, it's worth it in the end to find that one blade"

When you do get it on evenly, it looks great and lasts all day.  However, the description claims it easily washes off with water -- that is not true at all.

The only way the groomer could effect a haircut was to shave her and she looked like a shaved dog; not a professionally groomed dog.Not to be outdone by a simple problem, we thought, so we bought some Mane 'n Tail Detangler and had a much better outlook on keeping our dog groomed.

Keeps the face smooth and moisturized and clear looking. Doesn't clog pores. It's NOT a super heavy moisturizer, it's very light, but even though it's light, it still makes the skin feel properly moisturized after application. This is perfect for summer nights, but for people with super dry skin, especially in the winter, I would advise you pair this up with a light skin oil to boost the moisture if this isn't heavy enough for you. During this harsh winter, I paired it up with Maracuja oil (patted it on over it) on super dry nights. If you're looking for a heavy moisturizer or even something that is super moisturizing for very thirsty skin, you may not want to get this. But if you are OK with a light moisturizer that soaks right into the skin giving just enough moisture and leaves no oily residue feeling, this is for you"

I'm still ashamed of that, but consider it a lesson well-learned.  I say this because I love the products.  I just paid too much for them.  This particular product, the \\""lifting facial serum\\"" leaves my skin soft and supple.  Yes, it feels oily when it goes on, but my skin drinks it up very quickly.  Within 10 minutes, it has all soaked in.  I use this product and the \\""Replenishing eye serum\\"", as well as the \\""purifying facial cleanser\\"".  I truly like all of them and find that they last me a very long time.  I can get darned near a year out of them because you use just a bead of the stuff.I think that's the mistake some folks are making.  I use just a drop of the eye serum, which I put on the back of my hand, and then pat around my eyes with the other hand.  Whatever remains on my hand, I rub in (my hands have become much softer, too!).  I then put two drops of the facial serum on the back of my other hand, dot it around my face and rub it in, and then rub the excess into the back of my hand.  I use the facial cleanser every 2 to 3 days.  Again, you only need about a nickle-sized dollop and this does not just my face, but my neck and decolletage.  Don't use too much.  Big mistake.So, from using no product at all on my skin, I have a regular regimen now with these products and I am routinely mistaken for being much younger than I actually am.  Wish I'd taken better care of my skin all along!"

(I did try to swim in it... since the packaging says 'waterproof'!)  I'll be honest, I've only tried the product twice, because the second time I wore it, it burnt my eyelids and I had to take it all off after a few minutes.  (It did the first time too, but not as badly.)  It wasn't too bad, but painful enough for me to never use this product again.It looks nice when it first goes on, but isn't really waterproof, and I think the waterproof formula gave me an allergic reaction or something.  (I've never had any problem with a makeup product before - especially not burning...)  So, my advice is, try this stuff out on your skin before you try it on your eyes.  It does apply pretty easily and has staying power - it's a nice color as well; too bad it didn't work for me :(Anyway, I gave it 2 stars because it does exactly what my 3$ gel liner can do, and the gel doesn't set my eyelids on fire"

Rife with descriptions of the splendor of the land, the squalor of poverty, the fear of oppression, and the joy of triumph.  Jews in America have been, for almost 100 years, the  single most successful ethnos in the country, and have been jealously  attacked for gaining that success.  Stephen Isaacs has compiled a detailed  record of settlement, development, and difference.  In so doing, he  describes a panorama of people, small in number but alive with ideas and  potential, while at the same time being divided by language, culture, and  faith.  He brilliantly relates the growth of Jewish immigration to the  growth of America herself, and the changes in the economics, ethnography,  and physical geography of cities.  And he adds real personal insight--the  most necessary ingredient to a successful book.  READ IT!"

Have been playing blackjack for over 9 years now. Have tried it all, positive and negative progressions, card counting etc., and let me tell you that this is the best thing I have ever used or seen in print. Mr. Moore has a strategy that is both easy to use and does win most of the time.    I read the book 5 times and took a great deal of notes. Then I practiced about 2 to 3 hours every single day for 7 weeks. Finally I went to Las Vegas for a 6 day trip. I played 20 sessions in a little over 15 hours of total play. I won 70% of my sessions and 700 dollars profit. I then used it again in Tunica a few weeks ago. This time I played for a little over 34 hours and won 1855 dollars. So this thing can and does work. You must read and apply what it is that he teaches in the book. Expect to win only about 30 to 40 dollars an hour placing 10 dollar bets. If you go in knowing that this is what you can expect to win, then you are well on your way to being a very good blackjack player. No card counting involved and a strong basic strategy is included in the book. Just a great manual.    If you have any questions you can also email Mr. Moore at the books website and he will give you a prompt reply as he has done for me many times. Get this book and use what it teaches you"

The topic is current, and interesting to both traditional SF fans as well as those interested in current fiction. I really wanted to love the book.    The science seemed great, but I don't know genetics and simple errors in other areas made me wonder if there were errors in the science. The one that first got me was a simple error about time difference between the US and England. With writing and editing that let that error in, my confidence was eroded.    The character development was pretty good, though I found the variation a bit more flat than another reviewer. The development was certainly better than I expected in something billed as a techno-thriller.    The fictional evolution of a new intelligent species puts a great burden on a writer. The very existence of the species requires one to come up with a new style of thinking and accompanying personalities. Few authors can pull this off effectively. I found Bear's effort unconvincing. This left me not believing in the resulting character development and events.    I wanted to love it. Really, I did.

And the best part of all is that, even if you weren't around in the summer of '74, or didn't live in suburban Connecticut, or didn't have parents at each others' throats day in and day out, you still relate to this twelve year old kid because Dan Pope has reconstructed a slice of childhood probably better than any I've read before. It's that moment in the cusp between the carefree days of childhood and the angst of teenage life that he has captured here. It will be extremely disappointing if this novel doesn't eventually make its way onto the screen. It's every bit as engaging and precise as Stephen King's \\""The Body\\"" (later turned into one of the greatest \\""coming of age\\"" movies ever made, Stand By Me"

The main idea was that the Black Death in the Middle Ages decimated Western Europe, leaving the world to be divided between the Moslems and the Chinese. I expected a rather straightforward history based upon this premise, so I was rather surprised to get a very long book that dealt with the history almost as an afterthought.  The main function seemed to be concentrated on the idea of reincarnation, and various religious and philosophical concepts. There was just too much of that, and too little story to make this work consistently interesting. The last section, for example, I found entirely superfluous. That being said, the writing was  very well done, and the characterizations excellent. It's not the book it purports to be, so be warned in advance. You may like it, or you may hate it"

But it is just flat out a great quotation book. I was recently doing a search of my quotation books (I have over 400, and regularly refer to about 50 of them) and this book had the best quotes I found, regardless of color.I was looking for quotes to help a friend doing a book on the negative aspects of big business. Most quote books only provided positive quotes. This book had quotes by Martin Luther King Jr,, Angela Davis, Malcolm X. which fit perfectly, and not just referring to realities of people of African heritage. This book reflects a different way of looking at the world, a perspective that evolved from slavery and a history of having to fight to gain the grounds of freedom and equality. It is a great book for all students, not just ones of African heritage. We all need to think about the world, about life, work, God, happiness-- all the topics good quotation books explore-- from the perspective of the people of color.Dorothy Winbush Riley, an elementary school principal and former teacher first put her quote collection together for students.

I enjoyed the fact that Ms. Rice finally made Louis a main character again. She has barely even used him in past books, except for \\""Interview...\\"". As most other reviewers have said, if you are a new fan to Anne Rice and her Vampire Chronicles, you don't want to pick this book up first. There would be too many question you'd be asking yourself, that you wouldn't be able to read the book. (An Example of which is \\""How did Claudia die in the first place?\\"")  The book stays strong with following the Talamasca, most of all with the narrator being David Talbot, the 70+ year old, former Superior General of the Talamasca. He tells his story of how he came to know, and fall in love with, the yound and very Beautiful Merrick Mayfair, and the past that leads up to the present story. Davids story stays mainly in the past, from when he first met Merrick, to her upbringing in the Talamasca Motherhouse, and their adventure in the Guatamala Jungles. Only afterwards does the plot unfold: Will Merrick be able to rise the spirit of the dead Vampire child Claudia? If you are a strong fan of Louis, and of his very humanistic traits and emotions (even for a vampire), then the ending will be an amazing shock for you. You may even shed a tear or two.  The only thing I did'nt like was the CONSTANT mention of Davids undying love for Merrick. Yes, I know, if there was no love, there would be no story. It starts out fine, but after a while, it will possibly get on your nerves. None the less, I found when i was reading, i didn't want to put the book down"

Many of the characters lacked  creditability (Ginger, first of all; Kim; Thelma) and the storyline went  off on tangents that were better left alone. Cousin Kim's ordeal was  completely unbelievable-- who actually does those things?  The gay  storyline off-shoot was unnecessary-- there was no room for it in this  book.  Ginger's character was almost downright pathetic.  I'm reading One  Better now in hopes that feedback from this novel and experience have made  her a better writer, but it's not looking hopeful halfway through.

This, on  the other hand, started to make me yawn!  The last third of the novel  picked up and was much more readable than the first two thirds! If you want  my advice, read Ms. Gage's other books first, but skip this one!   Confession is not a good representation of Elizabeth Gage's talent as a  writer.

Readers who have read GATHERING BLUE will quickly recognize Matty, the once rowdy, dirty boy who traveled the forest with his little dog.Now a citizen of The Village, Matty has learned to read and write, keep clean and is even learning not to lie (though he's still not sure about the practicality of that rule). He lives with Seer, the blind man who sees more than many people with 20/20 vision. Leader, who readers will recognize from THE GIVER, has the ability to actually \\""see beyond\\"" the forest that warns so many not to enter its woods.Matty, however, has never had a problem with Forest and continues upon its paths happily until an encounter with a frog changes everything he knows about himself. Will his name be Messenger or something more? Does he too have a gift like his friend Threader, his friend Kira who he left behind?When the loving people in the village begin to trade away the deepest beliefs and even their health for physical beauty and gaming machines, Matty has little time to learn about his gift or consider his future name. For now he is simply Needed--if the Seer's daughter Kira is to make it to the village before Forest becomes inpenetrable.In another beautiful installment, Lois Lowry contrasts yet again the frailties and strengths of the human spirit. Though I've heard this is the last in the series, I sincerely hope not. To know what happens with Kira and Jonah would definitely be worth wait for another story.Ms. Lowry's knowledge of nature again enriches this short but layered story.

He and Carol are separated but not a day doesn't go by that he doesn't miss her or hope that they will reconcile.He currently teaches at Arthur Clay College in a Manhattan suburb when he discovers that the previous occupant of his office walked away from this job.  When pranks appear, Lawrence thinks that the previous occupant is hiding out in his office.  When the capers escalate into something far more dangerous, a determined Lawrence plans to confront his tormentor who he believes is the reason Carol is keeping her distance from him. James Lasdun's debut novel is a powerful tour-de force about a man's ability to twist reality to suit his need to delude himself from the truth.

So is some one out to get the paranoid somewhat tormented Lawrence or is the threat to his peace inside his mind?

It provides a overview of the politics in Texas from the time of the ""Shivercrats"" in the 50's through the upheaval of campus protests in the 60's to the current landscape where Republicans occupy the majority of statewide offices.  The author is an attorney who was engaged over his career in Texas in a number of lawsuits seeking equity in voting rights for minorities and in funding among public schools, among other social justice issues.The autobiographical structure of the book provides an engaging contrast between the (potentially dry) discussion of litgation and the personal growth and escapades of the author and his rowdy  and adventurous friends.  The legal points are explained in terms that non-attorneys can easily grasp and the outcomes of the cases demonstrate that progess can be made, bit by bit, in dragging civilization forward to a more progessive place if you are clever and persistent and sometimes just downright lucky.  It is a must read for anyone wanting to understand the political history of Texas, or for students of public affairs seeking insight into the realities of how policies are made and changed.  It is also a very enjoyable read for anyone wanting to get a feel for Austin during its best years -- when the music was great and the living was laid back.  Some of the anecdotes made me laugh out loud, which is one of the greatest compliments a book can elicit from me.

Believe it or not, he says the positive side of having it has caused him to become a better and stronger person. Once you have reached rock-bottom, there is only one to go and that is up. He describes how he has come to terms with having Parkinson's and all the emotions that accompany the disease, such as anger, depression, regret, loneliness, and bitterness.  Michael went through some rough times after he found out he had Parkinson's.  The book tells about the suffering, drinking, trying to keep his television show going and having to hide his symptoms of Parkinson's from the public.The saddest part of the book is when he tells his wife about having Parkinson's.  His children call him ""shaky dad"".  You can't help but sympathize with him.

With Wishes for You, she succinctly and poetically creates a road map for the life of a child, wishing her or him--this book is for children, not boys or girls--the happiness of being alive, of loving one special person, of feeling your body move--understandable since Tobias is a prominent dance critic-- of being creative. Each wish stresses individualism in universal terms, the most compelling of which are\\""I hope you will know what you think and feel and not let other people tell you\\"" and \\""I hope you will love being alone sometimes.\\""  These and the rest of the wishes in this book are ones I had for my own daughter at the time of her birth 27 years ago. Danish artist Henri Sorensen's illustrations are more than that: each painting particularizes a general wish: \\""I hope you will love to read\\"" shows an Asian child with a book, a stuffed hippo, a live cat, a globe;\\""I hope you will never forget how to be silly\\"" is illustrated with seven blond blue-eyed kids pretty clearly giggling as they pull one of their number in a cart.

It is a fast, stimulating, upbeat, and useful read. The author, Deborah Jackson, is a journalist and mother of three.This book will appeal to people who are already part of a tradition of motherhood, as they will enjoy a further connection with tradition, and are bound to come across new and useful insights. It will also be useful to the woman immersed in a busy, western style life, who has little or no chance to slow down and make that connection. For those mothers this book may kick-start their intuition or deliver a fresh paradigm, a new way of experiencing their life change.I like the breezy style of writing which touches on various cultures in meaningful ways:\\""There are cultures in which childbirth is a major social event. When Navaho Native American mothers go into labour, the whole tribe gathers round to eat a meal and enjoy the spectacle. Among the Gasque people of Spain, a mother in labour is traditionally attended by her whole family. Weather allowing, the birth takes place outside, near a running stream. There is singing, story-telling and jokes to 'massage the mother and baby with laughter'. Yemenite women expect their neighbours and friends to visit during labour, to lend moral support, chant prayers to Allah and help out if necessary. In Yucatan Maya women in labour are not isolated from day-to-day life. They give birth in a blanket, slung from the rafters for privacy... .\\""This isn't to convince the woman of the western world who is immersed in a corporate job and on the go all the time, to sling anything from the rafters. The intent is to give perspective. It's good to know how others have walked a road you are walking. Perhaps the reader will relax into the possibilities. In that sense it is like reading a guidebook about a place you are going to tour; it gives you a feel for the history, culture, and practices associated with a new land.Some suggestions and ideas could certainly be considered, such as planting a birth tree, or recognition of the benefits of colostrum: \\""This rich pre-milk is produced in late pregnancy and for three days after birth. ....

The novel truly depicted that struggles and obstacles of an interracial relationship, reflecting the prejudice and ostracism characteristic of that period. I don't confess to being a historical expert in that field, but racial discrimination against Native Americans were indeed rather prevalent then. Lance's vulnerabilities, insecurities and his profound desire for love and acceptance in a hostile society tugged at my heart-strings. His wounds and pain made him a more realistically conceived character. Furthermore,  his wariness display his fear of being hurt again. That's probably the his reason for concealing his love for the heroine, even though he fell in love with her when he was a mere boy because she was one of the few people who never mocked him. Yet his actions speak volumes about his feelings for her. In short, Lance was the epitome of the modern-day SNAG - a truly wonderful and masculine character.

If you are able to work past the first few pages where, for completeness, the author recounts the details of young John Adams's boyhood, you will be rewarded with an excellent read. Like all good history writers, McCollough is able to get in all of the facts and figures while not losing track of the story. And what a story he has to tell. From his work in cobbling together the political unity and resolve needed to unify the colonies behind the quest for Independence through his work in Europe securing a place for the newborn country and then his terms as Vice President and President, Adams continuously shows himself to be a man of character. A bit vain, perhaps, but aware of that vanity nonetheless. As the second President of the United States, John Adams was the first to take up the role after the universally esteemed George Washington. While Washington was in many ways untouchable in the political arena, Adams was the first President to be considered fair game. Adams does not prove to be much of a politician but what he lacked in political skills he more than compensated for with his wisdom and clarity of thought, especially in dealing with such matters as negotiations with a bellicose France. Kudos to McCullough in doing such a fine job of presenting a full portrait of a man who left an enduring imprint on our country. On a personal note, while reading about all the hardships that had to be endured in Adam's life - from the ravages of disease to the risks inherent in traveling - it makes one wonder how he got anything accomplished. It also makes the reader feel somewhat guilty for having accomplished so little though able to benefit tremendously in this age of modern conveniences"

Torie grieves her loss because she truly loved her cantankerous but honest boss and thought the senior citizen would be around forever.  Shockingly at least to Torie, she inherits Sylvia's wealthy estate including the historical Gaheimer House.Torie begins the monumental task of cataloguing the many boxes filled with objects letters, pictures and other documents dating back over eight decades.  However, one odd 1920s postcard with a picture of a young girl on the front and a strange message on the back that says \\""I think you have forgotten your promise\\"" surprises Torie as the two sides do not gel.  The genealogist soon learns that Sylvia hired a private detective.  Unable to resist especially as she begins to wonder if her boss was murdered, Torie seeks the truth of today and of what happened in the late 1920s, but someone very much alive wants her to stop or she and her extended family members will die.The latest Torie O'Shea is an entertaining amateur sleuth novel though describing the heroine as an amateur seems wrong due to her skills developed as a genealogist.

WortzelIn China and the People's Liberation Army, Solomon M. Karmel expands the thesis of an earlier writer from the United Kingdom, Gerald Segal, arguing that China is a weak power, not a superpower or great power. Karmel starts out by quoting a Chinese text, The Chinese People's Liberation Army (Deng Liqun, et al., Beijing, 1994), which argues that to be a superpower, a nation must possess four qualities: a large, diversified national economy; a major conventional military force; a nuclear weapons capability (and the means to deliver the weapons); and a strategic geographical location. He then systematically argues throughout the book that ""in China's case, the dilemmas of development are simply too great for the state to exert the type of great power influence over East Asia that the Soviet Union exerted over Eastern Europe and its many satellite states throughout the world."" He believes that ""China's security and freedom from occupation threats in the postwar period have done little to enhance its power over other states."" It is Karmel's thesis that those who argue that China is a great power are misinformed, and those who believe China is a military threat are crying wolf. Having defined his terms carefully in the initial chapter of the book, Karmel goes on to justify his thesis in subsequent chapters relying on extensive primary-source research in Chinese-language publications and Western secondary sources. In six well-argued chapters, Karmel systematically dismantles China's military force structure, which he views as weak and poorly integrated; its military-industrial complex, which he characterizes as anemic and plagued by inefficiencies and corruption; the defense budget, which he believes is wasting a lot of money on the wrong priorities; and the role of China in Asia, which he defines as increasing in power but still inadequate to qualify China for great-power status. This is a readable book. Its weakness is that it is supported by research that is full of glaring inaccuracies which seem to reflect a lack of familiarity with the military in general and with the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) in particular. The author is simply wrong when he explains the force structure of the PLA, saying that the seven regional military commands, analogous to the unified commands of the United States, are subordinate to the army. They are not. The military regional commands of the PLA are subordinate to the General Staff Department and the Central Military Commission. They are joint, and although the ground forces dominate them, they are jointly commanded and structured. The author is also wrong in his characterization of the development of the General Armaments Department from the Commission of Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense (COSTIND). Karmel argues that COSTIND turned into a structure of state-owned military-civilian defense industries under a State Science and Technology Commission. In fact, when the General Armaments Department was created, it took over much of the military production, research, and development. However, some production did stay under the old COSTIND, but was more centrally controlled by the state. Harlan Jencks, whom Karmel quotes extensively, has called the new organization SCOSTIND, for ""State COSTIND."" In other areas, Karmel's careful culling of sources to prove his thesis has missed such PLA authors as Li Qingshan and Li Jijun, who have published extensively on joint warfare, military production, and strategy. Karmel also fails to credit the PLA for its earlier successes in doctrinal and force structure modernization based on the PLA's study of US Army Field Manual 100-5, on warfighting doctrine, and a thorough review of the US lessons learned from the 1991 Gulf War. To respond to some of Karmel's arguments suggesting China is a weak power, one needs only to remember that at the mere suggestion that ""relations with China would be difficult,"" the Clinton Administration refused to approve badly needed air and cruise missile defenses for Taiwan. When China suggested that ""it would not be good for relations,"" the Republic of Korea opted not to participate in research on theater missile defenses in Asia with the United States. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) regional forum (ARF) was formed primarily to respond to China. Vietnam is seeking a new form of security relationship as a balance against China. With regard to Karmel's claim that China's military industry is poor in general, although it does have its problems it managed to supply Pakistan with a nuclear and ballistic missile capability, it managed to build a force of approximately 400 ballistic missiles for use against Taiwan in a relatively short period, and it has managed to produce a strategic nuclear force capable of hitting the United States. The threat of force from China has deterred elected leaders of Taiwan from scheduling a referendum on national sovereignty and self-determination. And in the United Nations, China has a veto in the Security Council as a permanent member. This reviewer has not accomplished the extensive literature search of Solomon Karmel to define ""great power status"" versus ""superpower status,"" but all of this evidence suggests that China's power seems great. If one is going to read Karmel's work, it should at least be read in conjunction with other texts by authors far more familiar with militaries in general and the PLA in particular"

I have seen him on TV numerous time and generally liked what he was talking. Once he made a great comment on FOX channel, he takes the trades only when he kind of sees money lying on the floor. In other words, he goes for sure bets. Now there is nothing like a sure thing in investment but still, a reasonable due diligece goes a long way...His book does try to convince you that commodities movement will not be over by the time you join them! He indicates that these cycles run for years, because creating additional supplies, new mines take- time.I would recommend for those trying to diversify their portfolio"

Too bad the master is dead, for gifted authors Eve Marie Everson and G. W. Francis Chadwick have brought us another such tale in Shadow Of Dreams. Everson and Chadwick thrust their readers into one environment in the opening chapter only to transport them a few chapters later to another environment, another locale, so much different from the first, and yet both of them are believable. Not only were Everson and Chadwick able to make both locales believable, but they possessed the talent to showcase danger and the seamy side of life while capturing believable relationships of childhood friends reunited, as well as a mother and daughter who fit together like a square peg and a round hole, while the authors searched for a file to help make the situation more palatable.Each page made me eager for the next without taking a break until I arrived at the concluding page, not only expecting another book, but wanting another book, making me realize that these two authors studied Pavlov well.

She is an EMT in Tioga County in the wilderness of Pennsylvania where we both grew up. I thought she would enjoy reading the stories of a fellow small town EMT. Like the author I grew up in a small town then left for the job opportunities and cultural attractions of living in the big city. Unlike the author I have never returned but my sister and our family still live there. The night I purchased the book I skimmed through the pages, was interested and started from the beginning. The stories and narrative said a lot about living in a small town that is slowly dying, and the closeness of a family trying to make a difference. The joy and sorrow of survival and death made the book an emotional experience and I was thoroughly hooked. I stayed up all night and finished the book over breakfast. The ending of the book is especially well done and left me craving for what happened after. I hope the author writes a sequel as I really want to know how his life faired. There is a made for TV movie in here if not a feature. How did my sister like it? She also stayed up all night reading it and it is now circulating through her volunteer fire department in the mountains of Pennsylvania.

And it's a loooong book.)A necessary first biography(In the sense that it sets out the chronology of a life, but in no way sufficiently addresses any one of Walcott's multiplicity of interests. This biography is data for other biographers, historians and historians of science to use for reference.)Unfulfilling(In the sense that a casual fan of the Burgess Shale fossils will be unsatisfied with respect to the explication of their significance to science, and to the history of science.)Tearful(In the sense of having read 1022 pages [including the first volume of Walcott's early years] of what is essentially a daily diary, and knowing that those diary entries would ultimately cease with his death. The day-by-day, season-by-season chronology develops a rhythm and momentum--a stateliness--into which the reader finds himself or herself drawn. Speaking for myself, I was unprepared for any of it to end. [Thank you, Dr Y!])Readers need to be patient with Yochelson. He explicitly discusses his approach (page 435) in this first full biography of a truly huge life-Yochelson felt compelled to choose between chronology and theme. He opted for the (thankless, lifeless) former. Some readers will find this approach to be unsatisfactory.Having now read both volumes I feel replete, as well as depleted. I have two wishes:1. That others (not excluding Ellis Yochelson himself) will take up the themes of Walcott's interests (geology, paleontology, conservation, forestry, photography, aviation, business, art) and treat each of them in a dedicated way.2. That the Smithsonian takes steps to return to the Dominion of Canada all of its fossil collections made by Charles Doolittle Walcott. (Yep, that's my wish.)

Her decline began after the disappearance of the younger girl, Elise. Elise ran away, and the older sister remained to care for her parents, now alone with a frail, failing father. Aunt's only comfort is liquor (yet another liquid) and as she sips she tells the child distorted versions of \\""The Three Little Pigs\\"", evocative of the sisters' childhood.At times stunning, at times confusing, the broken narrative combines images and feelings to tell a story, one of loneliness, abandonment, loss, grief and perhaps, incest. \\""Seal your lips, as Mother said.

The wife and parents and child (and dog) of the victim come together in moving way to cope with bereavement, and are helped by a minister (although it's quite high on sex and violence). I think the reviewer who complained of exposition has a point. She tends to tell us what to think of a character before showing us. For example Joanna Brady's parents are introduced as ""rock-solid, salt-of the earth type people"" Not as much humor as I personally like, although a certain amount in the portrait of Joanna's non-supportive mother.

The point of the book is not about \\""who did it\\"" or \\""what the code mean\\"". It's about the last days of four college students, before going to the real world.   The book gives you a background of 4 friends, how they met, how they become roommates, how they think about life, the incident that change their friendship forever, and how each of them move on.   Although the de-coding and historical details are impressive, I like this book more because of its description of the feeling of students before graduation. Most of them don't know what they want. Although they have many choices, what is the right one? Graduation can be both happy and painful at the same time. It may be the first time you realize that your fun as teenagers is finally over.It's time to enter the real world of adulthood and responsibility.

I have only spent limited time in Madrid but have toured large sections of the country.  As a result, I found it difficult to put the book down as I found myself reading about places I had been and things that I had done.  I too shopped at Corte Ingls and brought home Mephisto shoes.  I too became curious about bull-fighting and its lore.  Nevertheless, the potential reader should not look at this as an insider's book.  On the contrary, once one gets over the intimacy of experiencing this family's daily life and experiences, with which everyone can identify, there is a cornucopia of information written in a very easy-to-read format. There are so many varied glimpses of the author's  reactions to things that they experienced and places they went, as well as a compelling description of daily life as albeit temporary transplants in Madrid. The details are what make it fascinating.  It is a travelogue as well as a fascinating story of family life.  Who would not be anxious and then gratified to learn that the small children's initial antagonism to a strange place and strange school, with people saying things they did not understand, would gradually give way to relative fluency and enjoyment of the madrileo way of life?  I highly recommend this to anyone about to spend time abroad with their family, and to anyone thinking of visiting Spain for more than a day or two.  Vale la pena!"

It was as if he wanted to say, \\""Nah nah nah nah boo boo,\\"" about everything he was relating to his readers.  As  I continued deeper into the book, though, his style grew on me and I really  enjoyed reading it.  The author does make a few mistakes in his reporting,  though; for instance, Casey Stengel did not win eleven American League  penants and eight World Series while managing the New York Yankees.   Stengel won ten AL penants and seven World Series with the Bronx Bombers.   This type of error hardly ruins the book, but it is especially irritating  considering the author's know-it-all attitude.  The main premise of the  book is that baseball historians are too sentimental about the past,  referring to different eras as the \\""golden age\\"" while shamelessly  glossing over the game's seedier moments.  It would be hard to argue  against this theory.  For years sportwriters were well aware of Babe Ruth's  excesses off the field, but refrained from reporting them to the public  because journalists were not as cutthroat as they are now and they wanted  to protect the game and Ruth's image as a legendary hero.  Part of the  game's long history involves events that weren't pretty, but nonetheless  deserve their mentions in the history books as much as the great moments.   It is both humorous and frightening to read about the animosity with which  men like Ty Cobb, John McGraw, and Billy Martin operated.  The constant  feuds they caused are an important part of the game and shouldn't just be  swept under the couch like they never happened.  The strange thing about  this book is that the author can't seem to decide whether he should  celebrate the bad behavior of players past and present or condemn it.  The  next time he takes on such a lofty project, he should determine the  attitude he is going to exude towards his subject matter, whether that  attitude be good, bad, or indifferent.  Such an approach would lend his  book more consistency"

I hate people, who prech how bad smoking is for your health. I loved smokiing and it helped me deal with my job, kids and wife. I have five kids. Smoking was my only vice. I also did not care about going inside myself. ... Even while reading the book, i felt that it just another stupid quit smoking book, preaching how bad smoking is. The book does preach at times but it is also very philosophical and scientific. So, I continued  to read on and do the  relaxation techniques each night and followed the assignments. Well it has been 5 months, since my last puff  and I won't go back!  I nic-ed my Nic-o-tine addiction. This book helped me rethink my life. The book is not  for everyone, being that you must do the exercises and most people don't like to follow directions, second the book is a bit too harsh. You also must smoke while reading it. This i found limiting. But how can I complain about a book that helped me quit!  Read it!"

I have read many Oriole books in the past, but none that really told me what had happened.  You see, I am 27 now and the first thing I can remember is winning the world series in 1983.  So, there is about 300 pages of stories and information that are totally new to me.  From the standpoint of a fan who wants to learn more about how the Orioles became what they are in Baltimore this was a very interesting book.       John Eisenberg gives a list of the players he interviewed and a short two lines about them.  This was extremely useful to me and I refered back to it often.  As the previous reviewer said, I was surprised that Chuck Thompson and also John Miller were not included in the interviewed group, but I'm sure Eisenberg couldn't interview everyone.     From an Oriole's fan perspective, this was an interesting book to read, to learn about how the team got to Baltimore and the different phases of development to the present team.  If these things don't interest you then definately skip this book.  But I found it to be quite interesting and truly enhanced by the short blurbs from the people who Eisenberg interviewed"

Akin is the first child born to the blended family of Human and Oankali parents, and as such, is a harbinger of the future to those humans who have accepted the Oankali.  He is, however, just as much a symbol of the precious birthright of humanity--forever lost.  The human race is divided into two groups only:  those who accept the Oankali, and those who refuse to.  The former group is permitted its fertility, and produce children with the aliens. The latter group is forbidden to reproduce. Thus is Akin, the most human-looking of the new generation, stolen by the 'purist' humans in an attempt to restore their reproductive freedom to themselves.  Again, the portrayal of the characters, both alien and human, is powerful enough that even a reader firmly humanist in opinion may find himself feeling sympathy for the Oankali.  The second book in the Xenogenesis series is as powerful a read as the first"

Seemed a little sappy in premise, but it is a book with a 'big heart' and an important message for those who might question some of the central issues in life such as love, aging, materialism and death.The main character, Morrie Schwartz, is a well-loved professor of sociology at Bradeis University. He is renowned for his gentle and caring spirit, and he has touched many individual lives in a way most university professors don't. At the age of 75 he falls ill with ALS, an incurable disease which he knows will end his life slowly and painfully. Despite this condition, he maintains his positive attitude and busy schedule with classes and students and family and friends. As he starts to decline, a friend collects his aphorisms, little snippets of advice and wisdom, into a newspaper column. This column leads to an interview with Ted Koppel on NBC; this national exposure brings his former student, Mitch Albom to to his bedside. Mitch, a graduate of Brandeis and a student of Morrie's, has achieved great success at an early age. He writes a sports column in Detroit, and mingles with talented and wealthy athletes and team owners. He has an incredibly busy schedule flying to sporting events all over the country and he has acquired many of the vestiges of success. But when his unionized co-workers at the Detroit newspaper go on strike, he can't work and has the perfect opportunity to visit with Morrie and talk about life. He begins showing up every Tuesday at Morrie's home, to sit by his bedside and ask Morrie his opinion on topics such as love, marriage, forgiveness, and death. These conversations take place as Morrie declines week by week, his disease slowly creeping up his body. Morrie slowly surrenders to its grasp, becoming utterly dependent on his caregivers to feed, clothe, wash and thump him on the back so he can breathe. Mitch records this process of disintegration with pain and guilt, and is amazed that Morrie still maintains his appointments with friends and even strangers who were touched by his wisdom. Mitch carefully looks at his own life, and you can see him grow as they spend these last days together. At the end of Morrie's life Mitch is feeding him, holding his hand, and rubbing his feet, things which would have been unthinkable to him to do two months before. He is profoundly affected by this relationship.I took a lot away from this book about the mentor-mentee relationship. It started out in the formal educational system, in which Morrie was doing his job teaching Mitch in sociology classes. But it grew into a friendship both at Brandeis and after, as Morrie took the time to talk to Mitch, to have lunch, to give advice and to support. Their relationship grew as they embarked on this book, which Morrie called \\""their project,\\"" knowing it would find an audience and bring comfort to others. Mitch as the mentee actively sought out Morrie and steered the conversations to topics which troubled him or interested him. This contradicts what many people might think of these relationships - Morrie certainly had advice and enjoyed giving it, but he also asked questions and listened humbly throughout their many days together. Both gained, as Mitch absorbed Morries' wisdom and applied it to his own experience, and Morrie was loved and comforted in his final days. The truism I got out of this book was about the incredible importance of giving yourself to others. There are times when you would rather be alone, or you think that you don't have the energy to listen to others. But it is the kind of gift that is so easy to give and brings joy to yourself and others. Morrie gave generously of his time and elevated personal relationships to the highest level in his life. He danced every weekend, ate lunch with students and friends, took walks, always expressing his feelings freely to men, women, students and his children and wife. It was a lifetime of this giving that came back to him when he was dying. He even scheduled his own memorial service before he died, so that he could join in the remembrances. This was a wonderful book to read. At times the style is like a newspaper column, with short choppy sentences and paragraphs, but it is clear that this book has an incredible amount of heart. I of course want to know how Mitch lives his life differently because of those Tuesdays with Morrie, but I guess I won't really know without talking to him"

It questions man's ability to dictate a civil civilization in the presence of the sinful nature of man. This novel involves the betrayals between best friends, the traitors of a kingdom, and the competition for justice. It is a complex story of love, passion, happiness, hatred, envy, lust, and friendship. The reader is given an inside look into each characters' thoughts, and how these compel their actions.  This book also dives into the world of magic. Merlin was quite a mystery in this novel. Throughout this book Merlin gives clues about young Arthur's future of being king. Arthur, as a boy, was usually ignorant to Merlin's insinuations and never had a clue that he was to be king of all England. In addition, Merlin, even knowing the sad fate of Arthur, tries to maneuver Arthur onto the right path during Arthur's first few years of reign.  Although its lengthy descriptions and long narratives caused me to be easily distracted, I found the book very interesting. I could see how many trials in Arthur's reign parallel many world events today. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in political morals-choosing to do what is right rather than what is popular"

Although this book is ostensibly about preaching, it is really about experiencing and falling in love with God - over and over and over again. Barbara Brown Taylor has a deep sense of the magic and mystery of all of life, from the tiniest beetle's wing to the distant galaxies. She finds God in all people, including the ordinary folk of daily life, the proud and rich, as well as the crushed and downtrodden - the beautiful woman in the silken dress and the town drunk stumbling across the church lawn. And she is able to draw us into her vision, to make real for us the excitement of finding God in all people and all places.  The first half of the book is her own story, the often painful, often confused, and occasionally exciting journey towards an awareness of her vocation, her calling to be a priest and preacher. Along the way, she reminds the readers, though, that, for all of us, being Christian is about being a priest. Through baptism, we are all called to ministers, \\""representing God to humankind, representing humankind to God, and serving each in the other's name.\\"" She asks us to look at that calling with new eyes and live it wholeheartedly. The second half of the book is a sampling of her sermons, each a little gem, sparkling with fresh insights into old texts. Taylor has an unerring capacity to bring the texts to life in our present context, speaking openly out of her own life stories, and challenging her readers to experience the meaning of the text in the details of their daily lives"

Brett pulls all stops on getting the nitty gritty on BET from the first scandal to Bob Johnson's billion dollar deal with Viacom. Pulley reaches into the black community, along with the media world and close personal friends of Johnson to get the story of a lifetime.  Robert L Johnson is an even-tempered businessman with his heart set on making a deal as cheap as possible. He started BET with a $ 15,000 loan and thus paving the way for many up and coming African American entertainment moguls. Those who know Johnson personally would say he put the E in BET, which stands for entertainment. According to this book, Bob pulled out of business deals at the last minute, because he didn't want to put up a bulk of money to front the cost of production or any thing else he felt that was considered unnecessary. But Johnson always stood by his word and made powerful decisions, as he felt necessary. From the day he met his $15,000 obligation he built his way to a billion dollar deal with media powerhouse Viacom and went on to buy the Charlotte Bobcats of the NBA and the Charlotte Stings of the WNBA.   This book fits any American who understands what its like to have a dream and sit down and make the plans to achieve this dream to its fullest.

Just as El Nino has finished its trip through California and the sun has come out, David N Meyer releases another fabulous book driving me indoors for more of the greatest film I have ever been exposed to.  The five video stores in my immediate vicinity know me on a first name basis after the long rainy season which became almost cozy with his first book of hidden treasures, ""The 100 Best Films to Rent You've Never Heard Of."" Of course that book went beyond its claim and became the 100 BEST films I had ever seen, and then some, and then some more.       I can't imagine a more complete or concise guide and reference book packed into 302 pages.   The late night films that I grew up with are having new meaning and depth for me. His reviews are intimate and witty, his choices are superb, his opinions sizzle. I usually read his mood guide and plot summary; watch the film and follow with his review; and  then frequently watch the film again.  I am constantly overwhelmed by the richness of his recommendations and underwhelmed by the new releases now playing at the movie theatre. I carry his books in my car so I won't be caught near a video store without them!   The more informed that I become the more I realize I have been living in a small dark room. Not anymore!"

She works long hours and goes beyond the call of duty to earn the elusive brass ring, and nothing has ever distracted her; that, is until she meets the man upstairs, Quinn Sterling. While marriage and children have never been entirely ruled out of her plans, her interest in Quinn has entirely disrupted her vision of the future.Tired of dating women who are drawn to his fame as a professional hockey player, Quinn finds Dena's disinterest in the sport refreshing. For the first time, he experiences what it means to be appreciated for one's own merits. Their agreement to engage in a lighthearted affair, however, meets profound challenges as Quinn finds himself falling hard. Further, a car accident leaves him with the care of two children. Author Paula Bauer captures a story that easily could be real with rich prose and gentle understanding in THE MAN UPSTAIRS. Indeed, Bauer creates a marvelously complex heroine. She has become overly preoccupied with work, clearing illustrating her profound need for stability and rewards for her efforts. Consequently, Dena is ill equipped for falling in love, with our without children involved. She longs for deep friendships and connections to other people, yet she does not know how to establish and maintain them. Nevertheless, Quinn refuses to let her put him off, but his own challenges escalate with the arrival of children. The result is a marvelous character driven romance that readers will find entrancing.

For a poet, novelist, screenwriter and teacher, Danks has given us a light, positive novel that simply leaps off the pages with confidence and seductive passion.  The hero is a 17 year old basketball enthusiast named Prometheus Go, a Japanese-Greek-American kid who shares most of the values of every other kid in the US. It takes place in present day Philadelphia area with the story building around Prometheus' hopes to play basketball on a college scholarship, his meeting a mysterious, old man with one eye who teaches him to become a supremely great player, his counter, a thug named Mr. Zeus and his stooge Durk.  While the reader begins to cheer on Prometheus, we have a ball with the Greek names, his sister Athena, his mother Gaia, the beautiful musician Helen and for a great laugh, the dopey Taxi driver Al Charon. There's also Eris the slut, hired to reduce Prometheus into a crook.  There are a lot more characters too!  Beneath the plot are metaphors and allusions to Greek mythology galore, as well as a grand battle between good and evil. While ostensibly a juvenile novel, this is very important business at the root. This is why the novel is so good. It takes the reader on a simple trip through a time in the protagonist's life as he heads for adulthood and at the same time he's giving us good reasons for certain moral beliefs which are oh so gently inserted. The moralizing, frequently too heavy in young novelists, is there, but so subtile that you can miss it if you don' look for it! I loved this novel. It's only fault is that it's too short. I wanted it to go on forever! Fred James Bellingham, WA"
39161873,R169HIM4YQOLN6,1580510825,159369579,The Way to Love: Therese of Lisieux,Books,4.0,4.0,4.0,The Little Way of Love,"(Hope Ferguson wrote this review for Empire State College News.  She gave permission to send it.)    In 1988 Ann Laforest was \\""trying to pay back student loans,\\"" while caring for a baby of two married surgeons.  Because the baby slept a lot, Laforest found ample time for reading.  She began rading all of the works of Therese de Lisieux, a 19th century saint and Doctor of the Catholic Church, who is credited with the religious philosophy known as \\""The Little Way.\\""      \\""I was deciding whether I should go back to the monastery,,\\"" Laforest recalls in a telephone interview.  \\""The Story of a Soul, Memoirs of St. Therese\\"", was what initially prompted Laforest, at age 20 in 1954, to enter Carmel, where the lifestyle closely resembled the Carmel of her role model.  After earning her degree in human development from the Plattsburgh Unit of Empire State College, Laforest took a leave of absence to earn two master's degrees (a master of divinity in 1986 and a master in sacred theology in 1992, both from Boston University).     Laforest eventually did re-enter the monastery, but her time of soul-searching and study convinced her that the Catholic saint--young (she died at 24), female, and consumed with love for the \\""little people,\\"" the poor and disenfranchised--\\""had an urgent message\\"" for young people today.     She recently published a book on her role model, \\""Therese of Lisieux: The Way to Love\\"".  It took her eight years to write, and she sent it to only three publishers`before she found success with the Catholic publisher Sheed & Ward.  Laforest contends in her book that The Little Way is \\""nothing more than the gospel lived according to the signs of the times today.\\""  Therefore, she sees a relevant connection between St. Therese's emphasis on the \\""littleness\\"" (humility before God, and denial of human greatness) and the role of liberation theology (which posits a \\""preferential option\\"" for the poor by God), and such things as the abolition of slavery and discrimination.  As Laforest explains in her book, there is nothing more arrogant than another human being feeling he or she has the right to \\""own\\"" another.     She also sees a connection between care for the environment and the saint's Little Way.  There is a violation of The Little Way \\""when the owner of a paper mill knowingly pollutes a river and gives no regard to the suffering caused to human beings, wildlife and plant lif,\\"" she writes.  The saint placed a great emphasis on what she saw as the preeminent Christian virtue, love.  St. Therese felt that the gospel had to be lived out through acts of compassion for the helpless (slaves, children) and through acts of kindness toward ordinary people.  She noted that Jesus \\""emptied himself and took on the form of a slave.\\""  Thus, The Little Way emphasizes doing little acts that can lighten the burden for others, Laforest writes.     Laforest's book skillfully weaves strands of psychology, human development and spirituality in what is a scholarly look at the life of the saint.  Indeed, the book began its life as a thesis for Laforest's second master's degree.  In her phone interview, Laforest ticked off the names of those who she feels lived in accordance with St. Therese's Little Way: Catholic Worker founder Dorothy Day, as well as Oscar Romero, archbishop of El Salvador, who paid with his life in 1980 when he shifted his concern to care for the poor.  His theology radically changed after the murder of a Jesuit priest friend, who was also an advocate for the poor.     Laforest earned her degree in human development because of its connection with theology.  \\""For me the two are very related. Humanism is a way of worshiping God.  You accept people and love them regardless of religious belief, recognizing the basic human goodness that all religions affirm,\\"" she says.     Laforest spends her days at the convent in prayer and work.  Although the chores the sisters do can be anything from cooking, to transcribing acardinal's talk, to sewing vestments, to providing spiritual direction, Laforest's work centers around her writing.  She conducts correspondence and cotributes to the community newsletter.     \\""We are each only little people so we can only do little things,\\"" she says.  \\""We hope for success, but the success is not the point.  We do what little we can to promote the Kingdom of God"

Buffy is responsible for Selke's loss in the looks department (see the previous trade paperback, 'The Remaining Sunlight').  Nor will the story end here.  There are several more issues to go before the battle is completely resolved.  Once writers Andi Watson and Joe Bennet find a good thing, there is no letting go of it.'Hey Good Looking' (two parts) is Selkie's real dramatic entrance.  Literally ruined by being toasted by Buffy, Selke sets out to restore her good looks and get even with the Slayer.  While Buffy hunts ghouls the vampire looks for a good, but corrupt, plastic surgeon.  Selke finds that being a vampire with a terminal skin condition does not command much respect.  Poor Dr. Flitter!.In 'A Boy Named Sue,' Buffy has to deal with a band member with overactive glands and a blood drive that is drawing vampires from all over Sunnydale.  Selke's Dr. Flitter finally turns to magic and manages to... well, you will just have to read it.An additional story, 'Hello Moon,' may be new to BTVS readers.  Buffy meets a real Selkie during a walk by the seashore.  After a rough start, the two discover that they have things to teach each other.  Between dusting a few vamps, that is.It would be nice to have the entire Selke series all under one title, but there seems to be little hope of that.  There is simply too much of it.  Dark Horse was trying to emulate the television series at that time and wanted a story that would run for an entire season, with all kinds of story arcs.  'Blood of Carthage' is the next largest series, but rambles considerably less.As I have mentioned elsewhere, the trade paperbacks often simply reprise stories from the comics.  Thus, for those who do not have access to the original issues, they can be a great treat.  Do not expect a real graphic novel, though, just well executed artwork and an interesting story line.  These are, after all, comics, and should be approached with that understanding.

She is still sensitive to the painful memories of a  failed marriage and a miscarriage that haunt her. Now she has new hope as  her Aunt, also a doctor, tells her she is pregnant. Now the only thing on  her mind is staying emotionally and physically well and make plans for her  baby, but a very tall, very handsome problem shows up at her jewelry  business to put a kink in that.  After years of separation, Regan refuse to  see Cole. When he forces his way in, Regan gives him her best shot... right  on his shoes.  You'd think this would teach the man not to bother a moody,  pregnant woman, but noooo, because he has an agenda.  The way she looks,  even the smell of her perfume reminds Cole of a time years ago when he once  loved her and came to hate her even more. Twelve years is a long time, long  enough for Cole Thornton to become a rich, unforgiving man. Coming back  into her life may not have been the right thing to do, but he can't back  out now, not after its all been confirmed, and he is here to lay claim to  what is rightfully, legally his.When starting The Baby Bonus, I pretty  much knew there was more to the picture than a newly pregnant mother, a  scheming aunt, and a couple of kids who annulled a youthful marriage. The  subtle hints are dropped in just the right places to take the reader on a  ride of varied emotions, and reactions to expose the true story - like a  mini mystery.  The characters are wonderful; Regan is the outward runner,  always finding places to hide when it gets to be too much. Cole's reaction  is to find her and make her deal with it. He may be wise in what Regan's  needs are, but he's blind to his own answers. Cole is an inside runner,  fleeing from the true emotions that try to surface because of the rejection  he experienced twelve years ago. Regan's reaction to this is to try and  prove her emotions and hope he will find security he seeks.  Their  responses to each other and the part Aunt Liz plays in the storyline proves  those on the outside looking in do get a better picture, and maybe we  shouldn't take all advice with a grain of salt.The Baby Bonus is a  passionate story about people, rejection, trust and coming to grips with  the past..

Another winner from Smith!","Spares"" is Michael Marshall Smith's second novel, his first being the simply amazing ""Only Forward"".   Like its predecessor, ""Spares"" is an unusual mix of Douglas Adams like humour, Gibson-esque science fiction, fantasy, action, philosophy, adventure, romance and horror that all combines to create something disturbingly familiar yet satisyingly unique.    Set in a futuristic post-apocolypse America, ""Spares"" centers around the life of Jack Randall a down on his luck ex-cop who finds himself the guardian and protector of six spares; a group of cloned humans whos existance is due to a very sinister agenda by those in power. Having escaped The Farm with the spares in tow, Jack seeks refuge in New Richmond; an ex-flying shopping center made city, attempting to secure an escape vehicle for himself and his charges. But instead of salvation Jack finds himself confronted with his past and a frightening vista of reality known to Jack as The Gap. Stuck with no place to go Jack has no option but to fight the demons of years past.    Starting off relatively light hearted and humorous ""Spares"" quickly darkens in tone until at last the horrors of The Gap along with the ravages of drug addiction are revealed to Jack. This novel is a much darker and disturbing work than ""Only Forward"" yet is just as satisfying as a peice of literature.    The narrative is told by the central character himself and makes for an easier to read almost conversationalist tone. With this easily accessable style ""Spares"" can acurately be described as one of those book which is impossible to put down, despite its disturbing surreal overtones.    ""Spares"", while lacking the commentary on the human condition shown in ""Only Forward"", still makes some very astute observations on the human psyche. With its crucible of concepts and styles ""Spares"" comes highly recomended and quite possibly will become the best book you have ever read,  unless of course you have read ""Only Forward"" in which case it is a tie"

Murakami did a wonderful job again of creating memorable characters (May Kasahara in particular, but Creta Kano and the ""Akasakas"" were favorites of mine as well).  He told incredible tales: the story of Lieutenant Mamiya probably could've been a novel in itself.  Creta Kano's ""defilement"" was chilling, and her metamorphoses were equally stunning.  The Akasakas' tale was interesting too.But Murakami just couldn't tie it all together.  Many times I found myself saying ""what on earth was THAT all about"" ... the story of Cinnamon as a boy, where he crawls into bed with himself, for example.  Or Okada experiencing different ""self""s and different ""here""s.  However, my main source of dissatisfaction was Toru Okada himself.  In the midst of all of these dynamic and active characters, Okada just sits around waiting for phone calls, loiters around Shinjuku, and sits in his retrofitted well.  Except for a few, noteworthy events which stand out- his battle with death his first trip into the well, his battle with the musician, and then his knife-bat fight in the mysterious hotel room- there is very little substance to Okada.  Those three events were, for me, easily the highlights of the Okada Storyline.  The image I had of May Kasahara standing at the top of the well asking Okada how it felt to die little by little sticks with me still.  But the majority of the time, Okada just went around doing what other people told him to do.  By the end, he wasn't even in charge of the clothes that he wore.  He ""searched"" for his wife by sitting in a well designed for him in a house bought for him by the Akasakas.  I felt absolutely no empathy towards Okada.  In this surreal, harsh world that Murakami has created, Okada seems too pliable and soft for the protagonist's role.  If people like Okada are supposed to defeat the Noboru Watayas of the world, we're all in deep trouble.In the end, Okada is left where he started- waiting for his wife to return.  Reading the book, that's essentially how I felt: I had just gone through an amazing, convoluted experience just to end up right back where I was when I started ""The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle.""ms too pliable and soft for the protagonist's role.

Using numerous true to life vignettes, the author illustrate how God is at work through the Gospel both to save us by his grace, and transform us into the image of his own Son.  The authors identify what they call ""the Gospel Chain"" which includes both the Gospel itself (Revelation of Jesus Christ in Scripture and Justification by grace through faith) and the Goal of the Gospel (sanctification, mission outreach, and living to the glory of God.)

49375895,R3F5ZD60VGZ8C2,0896225607,337788146,Assembled in Christ: Forty-Four Liturgies With Lay Presiders,Books,4.0,4.0,4.0,A Useful Resource,"More and more laypeople find themselves leading communion services in the Roman Catholic Church. This creates a need for a structured liturgy that both preserves the distinction of a communion service from a Mass, and at the same time captures the solemnity of a eucharistic gathering. Other efforts, such as ""Sunday Celebrations in the Absence of a Priest,"" skip directly from the liturgy of the Word to the Lord's Prayer just before communion. This is jarring to Catholics used to the rhythm of a full Mass. This abrupt transition also tends to minimize the significance of the reception of communion by short-cutting the congregation's opportunity to recollect themselves during a longer preparatory prayer.     This is where Condray's work comes in. ""Assembled in Christ"" provides 44 liturgies which follow the same basic structure as the Mass: the congregational responses are in the right places and flow well from the text. At the same time, these liturgies are clearly different from the Mass itself: these are truly prayers for communion services, not merely edited versions of the Eucharistic prayer from the Mass.     The prayers are thoughtful and reflective, though sometimes Condray lapses into an excess of sentimental or self-referential language (i.e., the people draw more attention to themselves in their prayer than to God.) These problems can be easily fixed by choosing carefully from Condray's offerings, and doing a little selective editing.     A further quibble is with the lay-out of the book itself. Service leaders who are very familiar with the Mass can use Condray's text easily, but those less experienced will need extra helps: this book lacks the comprehensive structure of the Sacramentary used by priests, so one isn't lead line-by-line through the service as priests are. A future edition might benefit from following the structure of a Sacramentary more closely.     All in all, Condray has done the Church a great service byproviding a useful resource for leaders of communion services. I hope others concerned with community prayer when no priest is present will follow Condray's lead and provide further books of this genre"

Coming from a small town in rural Australia I had to order it into store so the wait was longer than expected but the book was definately worth the wait, even if it was a very short read.  Melissa's strong voice & poingnant lyrics helped me survive the 90's. They made me cry, they made me hurt & they made me stronger.  I believe if music can make you feel anything the lyricist or performer is doing something right. Melissa's honesty abouth her life in the book is to be commended although I felt she was still holding back something, but who  really wants to share the most personal feelings & emotions with the world. Even in an autobiography some things must remain sacred.As a hetrosexual woman I commend Melissa for writing a book which neither promotes homosexuality nor condemns it, she simply shows you that the important things in life are love, family, friends, compassion & music that makes you feel something.  Sexuality is personal and your personality makes you who you are.I reccommend this book to anyone who appreciates Melissa Etheridge as the master lyricist & performer that she has proven to be over the past decade"

It sounds great to just leave everything and go, even though I'm barely gradusting high school, and have no job...yet.

I found the theory rich and convincing, and the writing clear; the theory explains, for example, why one emotion (positive or negative) evolved into multiple emotions, each related to a different aspect of gene survival, such as satisfying hunger, finding a mate, etc.   Johnston's theory of emotion is a special application of a more general theory of consciousness. The rest of the book is kind of a grab bag. Johnston devotes too much space to refuting  an alternative  theory of human consciousness which he never adequately explains, and I suspect he is creating a straw man to argue against.  There are a few chapters devoted to Johnson's own simulations and special interests, and a quick review of evolutionary processes in general.  The review may be too quick for the unfamiliar reader.  The simulations involve genetic algorithms and neural networks.  I found the discussion of the former clear, but I was already familiar with the topic.  I am also somewhat familiar with neural networks, and the book is inadequate here:  Johnson seems to despair of explaining neural networks in a simple way, so kind of assumes the reader already understands them.  Outside of his special areas of expertise, Johnson may be prone to error.  Certainly, he is unaware of all the research on the socialization skills of primates, and I suspect that some of his statements on early child development are overly simplified..  All in all, this was a five star book for me, but it may not be for others with different backgrounds, either because they know less than me, or know more than me"

This book provides a excellent overview of 30 years of terrorism and counterterrorism, worldwide. Although in my opinion too concise in certain points, and the chapters 1 to 3 are 'guilty' of this because of their dry summary of (practically) every terrorist act in these past 30 years (my advice: don't read these chapters consecutively in one day), the overview is detailed, extensive and complete. Especially the chapters regarding to some of the most important counterterrorist operations (for example the raid on Entebbe, and the assault of the Iranian Embassy in London, as well as thirty years of activities in Northern Ireland) are very interesting and may give some new information to the relative layman. These chapters also puts the motives for the terrorists and their acts in a historical point of view, which provides a better comprehension of these acts. And to top it all, I've learned about counterterrorist units I didn't know existed (for example the American ISA or the French 29SA)....... and I have read quite a few books on the subject.Beside chapters 1-3, the last minor downside in this book is the overextensive attention drawn to the invasion of Grenada by the US military in 1983. Although the counterterrorist units Delta Force and SEAL Team 6 were involved, this operation can not be considered a counterterrorist operation; the use of the word 'invasion' was deliberate. Even the author points this out after the story about the operation. These cost the book its fifth point, but just marginally so.Again, for any one interested in the suject: you must have this book as a referncebook, but better to read it; once you have started in this very good read, it's difficult to close it..... and you just get motivated to know more. The world feels just a bittersaver just for knowing the contents of this book"

Dylan randomly hits on a variety of events in his life and passes over the major life changes almost altogether, such as his marriage (mentioning his wife but never by name), divorce, and conversion. (Perhaps he'll delve into these things in volume two).  He leaps back in forth in time at whim.  His writing is like that of an adult trying to sound hip for the kids: intentionally dumbed down and employing bad grammar.  He has scattered comments to make about his songs, some very enlightening, some mundane.  The book is filled with names, and although sometimes it is fun to take a peek at this or that celebrity or artist, at other times the names can become overbearing.  A few scenes are captivating; I especially like his reflections on the literature he consumed, and I laughed aloud at his description of his attempts to give his family breathing room from the media.  But at other times, I felt I could have skimmed page after page without missing anything of note.

It begins with a short article on the history of cider, particularly in North America and New England.  This is followed by a substantial chapter on methods of making cider in the past and in the present.  This section also describes tools and machinery, as well as bottling and preserving cider.  There is also a shorter chapter on methods and tools needed for small-scale home cider production. The last part of the book consists of a collection of various recipes that call for cider, from soup to main dishes, to pie.  The book is amply illustrated with high-quality black-and-white drawings and photographs. End material includes a short appendix of suppliers for cider making equipment and an index.This book is fun to read as well as informative.  Certainly, the quality of the historical research is excellent, and the facts are presently very coherently. A wide variety of information is included, from types of apples to use for cider making, to characteristics of the ideal pomace, to bottling and preservation methods for both sweet cider and hard cider, and even methods for making apple cider vinegar.  Orton bases his comments not only on his historical research, but also on his own experience, growing up and making cider on a traditional family farm.  On certain topics, he has some very firm opinions, which he shares with readers.  For example, he observes, \\""One of the most outlandish, and to me shocking, habits of the times we live in is that of swilling down drinks from up-lifted bottles.  No civilized person guzzles from a bottle if a glass or mug is available.  For American advertisers to condone and actually promote such a habit is a good comment on these times when manners have been abandoned and social customs of gentlemen and ladies decried.\\""  Such comments yield clues to Orton's personality-I wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of this guy, so when I make my cider, I'm going to follow his rules.'m going to follow his rules"

And then again, how many sail only because they love a person who loves to sail. This is Emy Thomas' story. How she overcame the fear, and the deprivation to be with the man she loved. She sailed with him in the Caribbean and Pacific for thirteen years and came to love sailing too.Many sailing books are maintenance and navigation encyclopedias. Others are cruising logs - the chronology and itinerary of the voyage. Emy's book is neither of these. Her book answers the very simple question - \\""what was it like?\\"" It is arranged by topic to address  typical concerns and inquiries - do you get seasick, how does the laundry get done, what about storms and hurricanes, and theft, how do you keep all those nautical terms straight, how do you keep in touch with folks at home, how hard is the work, what sort of people do you meet, what do you do with your garbage?Emy had lived more comfortably before. She and her sailing mate scraped by for thirteen years, stopping to pick up casual jobs when the money got low. But you get the feeling she would have had it no other way. They were accepted in many of the poorer islands they visited and had a richer experience as a result, not because they had a fancy yacht bristling with electronics, but because they didn't.This book is an easy read and highly entertaining for anyone who likes sailing or has fantasized about cruising the oceans.

Like a lot of others in America, he began in a poor family having to work at an early age - but he got a job at the local airport (sweeping the hanger, mowing the yard) and learned to fly. And he learned well. Well enough to be a Navy test pilot flying the latest and greatest Navy planes as they were being developed. And from there he literally went to the moon, the third man to walk on the moon. Reading about his life is quite interesting.   Reading about his dreams is even better. He was not just a flyboy driving the plane around. He was able to understand where space science might take us. After his Navy/NASA career he started four separate companies to privitize going into space. His vision included much of what has happened since, and much that is still to come.   One think I believe you can say about Pete Conrad, he lived life to the fullest he could.   His was a time when things were happening, before NASA became so bureaucratic, a time when the public looked forward to what was happening, where we were going. He had quite a ride"

What keeps me from giving the five star endorsement are a number of factors:1.  no pictures -- I didn't want to see any gory crime scene photographs, just pictures of the good and bad guys.  Seeing faces tends to bring things to life.2.  confusing -- There are hundreds of crimes and characters in the narrative.  As a result, it got very confusing at times.  I think the author should have thrown in some of the diagrams of the gangs and how they interacted with each other (like the way the prosecution explained things to the jury at the trial).3.  a bit wordy -- I think the author could have trimmed twenty pages from his narrative by weeding out overly long biographical sketches of peripheral players and by eliminating the office politics story.4.  dubious triumph -- I guess the elimination of the Wild Cowboys (aka ""Red Top"") is a definite triumph.  A bunch of killers were locked up.  Crime in the area they operated in has gone down.  But I feel a little queasy over the fact that two of the gang's leaders were allowed to plead out to non-life sentences for orchestrating crimes and street terrorism that merit, in my view, the death penalty"
53013446,R38S8RCYU7OKNZ,0380979020,547078013,Paladin of Souls: A Novel,Books,4.0,3.0,3.0,Welcome Back to Chalion,"This pleasant sequel to The Curse of Chalion contains all the hallmarks of the Lois McMaster Bujold style -- an underdog protagonist with unexpected strength, extremely engaging characters, three-dimensional villains, witty and epigram-laced writing so good you want to read it aloud to somebody, and clearly written action concerning a situation that starts out fairly complicated and gets a lot worse, and more complex, before it gets any better.  As usual, Bujold is compulsively readable.  I think if she wrote VCR owner's manuals, I'd stay up past midnight turning their pages.However, this is a lesser work than her previous novel in the same setting.  I think this is the nature of the setting she picked.  Readers of the past book have gotten the message, which was well-hidden until the end, that if you trust Chalion's gods and do what you know you ought to do, the gods will make sure things turn out okay in the end.  Curse of Chalion contained mixed blessings that made the gods seem mysterious and mercurial, but here, the gods speak to the protagonist face to face and whenever she gets into too much trouble, they give her another superpower that can get her out.  Also, readers of the previous book, knowing you get into more trouble ignoring the gods than taking their (admittedly oblique) advice, may be as miffed as I was at the protagonist for her perverse insistence on doing things the hard way no matter how many others suffer.Okay, I got that out of my system.  Now, don't let it stop you from reading the book.  This isn't the VCR manual I said I'd read if Bujold wrote it.  It's a fine novel, one of the best you're likely to read this year, and a welcome return to a vivid and fascinating world.  Just because it's not flawless (as Curse of Chalion is, or very nearly) doesn't make it not a gem"

When the three friends of the GAG club (Girls are Gross) return to Land's End to go into business together, they rename their association Bachelors Inc. and plan to restore old buildings to their past glory. All three men swear off women, just as they had when they were ten, promising to support one another in their efforts to avoid women; that is, until Owen's ex-wife comes back to town. Owen Thomas fell for Abby Maconnal when they were ten years old, despite his agreement with his buddies to stay away from girls. Even when the friends formed the GAG club, Owen couldn't help liking the pretty girl with freckles. Some things just don't change, despite hurt feelings and divorce. Ten years of marriage ended not with a bang, but with a whimper. Too many hours in the office, too many late dinners, and too many postponements of current pleasure for the promise of something better later left Abbey alone, empty and disillusioned. She and Owen didn't fight, didn't raise their voices, didn't disagree. They simply, quietly drifted apart until the day Owen came home to an empty home. A quiet, polite divorce seemed to settle it. An editor, Abbey saved until she could take a year off to devote to her own novel. On the way to her rented home in Florida, she stops by Owen's to pick up some precious keepsakes from the past. She didn't check the weather before leaving Boston, and finds herself forced to seek shelter with Owen rather than continuing to Florida due to a hurricane. Then an unexpected illness keeps her there even longer. Besides, Abbey finds she doesn't want to leave, nor does Owen want to let her go. But trusting feelings in the wake of a divorce proves to be daunting and difficult, at best. The concept of Bachelor's Inc. left this reviewer in stitches. The harder these guys protest against women, the harder the reader knows they are bound to fall. Moreover, Faulkner writes with a passion that brings these delightful characters to life. Even Max, the father of one of the bachelors, captures the imagination as he tools through town on his riding lawn mower. I have a weakness for well created miniseries because they allow the reader to linger in the world just a bit longer, lending the series a depth unequalled by stand-alone books. Although this novel certainly could be read alone, it exemplifies the best qualities presented by miniseries and comes Very highly recommended"

The purpose of this well-researched and highly detailed book is to integrate and present the authors ideas, developed over many  years of study, to help individuals start and grow their own businesses.  The work brings together the experiences of several hundred entrepreneurs  to examine what these people do and to understand their role in the context  of markets and the economy. The author also strives to explain  entrepreneurial success, concluding that profitability in small business  may be more a function of tactical hustle than solid long-term strategy;  persistence may outweigh detailed planning in importance. These conclusions  ring true to us based on our own organization and compensation consulting  experience with entrepreneurial enterprises. The book addresses the  nature of opportunities entrepreneurs pursue, their problems and tasks,  traits and skills they need, and social and economic contributions they  make. Comparisons are made between start-ups, evolving or transitional  firms, and established enterprises. An engaging, thoughtful book. Highly  recommended.

I would not agree with the other online reviews that Kate Carr is evil. I believe that she is terribly missunderstood and as the story unfolds it is easy to understand why.  Kate is only perceived this way because she is disturbed, but to some extent she's just being a normal teenager only slightly worse! Without giving anything away, Kate has a very oppressive religious father who has some strange habits including receiving strange phone calls at 8.28 every evening, and preaching in Bingo Halls. Together father and daughter share a very unusual relationship, they like to control and manipulate people by using what they refer to as 'It'.  Kate is very much her father's daughter but there is more to her than meets the eye.  Kate gradually unlocks her memory to discover the truth about what happened to her mother and how Kate got her disfigured leg - two things which she must never talk about.A really good read, even if it does have a slightly predictable ending. A good introduction to a very talented writer, I shall definitely keep an eye out for Penelope Evans' other novels"

Rasputin has remained a mysterious figure in Russian history and many have sought to find out the basic character of this peasant from Siberia who controlled the destiny of the empire through various nefarious means. Radzinsky provides a lot of information, historical background and a rich drama surrounding the people during this time. Just like a great Russian novel, the number of characters present is many. There are many intrigues and plots. Getting to know the real Rasputin remained an illusion.  Whatever he might have been, he was a shrewd, quick learner.He had a great capacity to understand people. How else can otherwise he would have such powerful hold on people?The discussion on the Khlyst movement is interesting and it reminds me of the Tantric system in India where sex is not only not forbidden, but is an integral part of religious practice. The American readers will surely remember Rajnish who a decade or so ago tried to build a group of followers with his ""Tantric"" system. Radzinsky has taken great care to present the detailed points of view for this Khlyst movement. It is indeed difficult to comprehend the logic of this system blending pagan rituals.I find this book very important to get an inside look of the tsarist Russia. It takes an effort to maintain attention to this book, as the writing style is a bit dry and boring. Otherwise, it is must for you, if you are interested in this period of history"

I love reading medical thrillers, but this was the first time I had come across a book billing itself as combining the genres of medical thriller and horror.  And Braver does it so very well.  The premise hits chillingly close to home, even for readers such as myself who don't have children.  What if you were given the opportunity to make yourself smarter?  Would you take it no matter what the cost?      Braver's writing is a joy to read.  It flows smoothly and seamlessly, which to me is the hallmark of a good writer.

Q says Spock should tell it to Seinfeld, would Spock know who Seinfeld is? But during the middle of the story, they drop the jokes and get serious when they begin to talk about if Q should bother to save the Earth from being hit and destroyed by a meteor that is coming as they speak. During this time, they return to character and become the Spock and Q we know and love. When it was all over with, I really did enjoy it even though the start was a little off character, but it was all in fun and did make me smile.Star Trek: Spock vs. Q-The SequelMore of the same. The story begins when Spock gives Q a formal thank you for saving the Earth from the last story when all of a sudden they are transported to a strange asteroid, where their personalities switch, Q becomes logical and has lost his powers while Spock becomes the prankster telling jokes and teasing Q along the way. Once again recorded for a live audience and in front of the same, the story is filled with more jokes and some are great. What makes this so priceless is the switch of character, Spock losing his logic is something that can't be missed.Bonus Video Disc of Spock vs. QEven though it is only five minutes and forty one seconds long, this is a video of the best scenes from \\""Spock vs. Q\\"" and one scene from \\""The Sequel\\"".

In Schindler's List, Thomas Keneally  goes beyond such shock value by telling of the profound goodness that  emerged--from such unspeakable evil--in the character of prison camp  Direktor Oskar Schindler and his Schindlerjuden.In his telling of the  story, Keneally's sure-handed prose adds credibility and its occasional  delve into the poetic adds great emotional weight. The effect of such a  telling is that of a slow toxin that siezes the reader by the heart and  squeezes to the point of anguish, leading to a novel that is both deeply  moving and absolutely believable.As for the story itself, Keneally  focuses mostly on the  the background, creeping around the edges.  Whenactions and ambitions of Schindler, leaving the horror stories recessed  in such evils are brought to the forefront of the tale, they are potent and  real, but somehow serve more as chiaroscuro to the divine goodness of  Schindler's deeds. Thus it is that much more effective when Schindler  spends every bit of his entire life's fortune to literally buy life for as  many of the Jews as he possibly can. When all is said and done, Keneally  has done no less than consecrate the sanctity of life by weighing its  importance against that of essentially meaningless things such as money.By telling the story of a good man living in such evil times,  Schindler's List has become an important addition to Holocaust literature"

Upon receipt, I was disappointed.  The book contains 80 pages. About 50 are dedicated to actual photographs.  Each photograph page contains 6 plates measuring about 2 1/2 x 4 inches. From a practical standpoint, this is very small.  The images are clear and sharper than in similar books.  However, this clearness does little to make up for the small scale.  The book uses 6 models. 4 women and 2 men.  In my opinion, with the exception of maybe one, the females are all of the same basic body type.  Think supermodel. They are generally long, lean, and slender.  The poses of the one female that may be a more realistic size and shape are crouching and covering type poses. When considering the men, one has what I would describe as a ""beach volleyball"" physique.  The other is a bit more burly.  All the models used are undeniably attractive.  Perhaps a bit too attractive. There is almost a generic, sterile quality to them.  Some of the most inspiring aspects of the human body are the variations and nuances. I don't know if that is represented in this edition.  Furthermore, the models sport very tight, unnatural bikini waxes.  Apparently, this necessitated some air brushing in some of the vital areas.  The accompanying cd-rom is a nice concept.  It offers the some of the same images as the book.  These images can be moved, rotated, and enlarged.  Unfortunately, unless you have a laptop or a dedicated PC/Mac in your studio, I don't know how useful it is going to be.  Although suggested elsewhere, I have not found a way to print the images. It is fun to play with. The accompying music is good.  Other than that, I don't know how much use I will get from it.  In conclusion, the overall concept of virtualpose2 is great.  I'm not sure if the intention was to publish a great book with a useful cd-rom, or a great cd-rom with a useful hardback reference. For me, neither are very satisfying.  Finally, larger pictures, less glamour, and less reliance on slick production would have made this edition much more functional for the practicing artist.y, larger pictures, less glamour, and less reliance on slick production would have made this edition much more functional for the practicing artist"

(If you need an introduction to chess and are willing to put in some time, I highly recommend the Idiot's Guide.)The following chapters are a series of puzzles to be solved.  The book starts with 1 move mates, and then progresses to 3-4 move mates.  Much attention is given to back row mating patterns.  Bobby Fisher wrote a one-page intro to each chapter. This must have been the requirement to get his picture on the cover.I did enjoy going through the puzzles, and the book is cheap.  It will not hurt a novice to go through the exercises.

If anyone else had written this book, I would have given it 3 stars, but I have come to expect much better than this from Mr. Lawhead.Cait is not a likeable nor a believable character, although she is slightly more interesting than Duncan.  Not to say too much, the entire episode with the prince completely undermined her integrity and she lost all credibility as a character.  I kept thinking (being a woman myself) that woman would NOT act that way.  (By the way, Lawhead has written another novel largely from a woman's perspective - Taliesin, in which Charis is the main character, and in which Lawhead did a fine job characterizing her and making her real and believable.)The story was slow, but Lawhead frequently begins stories slow.  Thus, throughout the book I expected it to pick up ... something interesting is bound to happen soon ... I confess I skimmed the last eighty pages or so just to say I'd finished it.Please don't get me wrong - Lawhead is a gifted writer, and at least the first volume of this series is very, very much worth the reading, but I'm afraid The Mystic Rose missed the mark"

If you don't know Marx as a sociologist, or are unfamiliar with Habermas, you may find some parts of Anderson's book including the afterward difficult. On the other hand, if you relate to the nexus of linguistics and poststructuralism in literature, this book may be your cup of tea.

Very comprehensive -- covers earnest Sixties folk, acoustic blues, acoustic guitarists, bluegrass, modern Americana, some gospel, some Hawaiian music, and more.

A little too dismissive of some of the early '70s songwriters, and skips many children's music artists (Ella Jenkins, sure -- but shame on you for omitting Barry Polisar!)  I'm a little puzzled as to why there are so many country artists in here, especially when MusicHound already has a separate volume devoted to twangsters -- if they're going to include honkytonkers like Ernest Tubb or Johnny & Jack in this book, why not everyone else?  But overall this is an outstanding reference work.

He belonged to the Grand United Order of Odd Fellows.  Membership in this organization provided historian Mick Salvatore with a clue to assess the ""Thermometer Book"" of Amos Webber, a detailed impersonal chronicle, and to find the history of the man, Amos Webber, a light-skinned African American, a soldier in the 5th Cavalry.  Webber was born in 1826 in a small town in Bucks County Pennsylvania.  He moved to Philadelphia when a young man and attended the Presbyterian Church.  Webber's political activism was nurtured by the organizations to which he belonged.  One black Presbyterian minister declared that he would preach the Declaration of Independence until it began to be put into practice.  Salvatore writes of abolitionist activities in Philadelphia and festivals, such as the one held to celebrate the abolition of slavery in the West Indies in 1838.  Webber underscored the significance of John Brown's activities.  Webber enjoyed a niche in society akin to that occupied by the white  middle class. There was a popular interest in meteorology.  By the 1830's there were a series of civilian observers organized by leading scientific investigators.  Amos Webber had little formal education.  His weather book served multiple purposes of weather journal, commentary on natural patterns, and a way to record his observations of the world around him.  His weather books included press clippings.  Webber's employer went bankrupt and the business closed in 1860.  The Webber family moved to Worcester, Massachusetts.  The first volume of his chronicle concluded in October 1860.  The start of the second volume is a decade later.  Webber was employed in a wire mill.  Black collective life appeared thin in comparison to Philadelphia.  In Worcester the fall of Sumter caused general excitement.  In January 1864 Amos Webber reported to Camp Meigs at Readville, Massachusetts for service in Company D, Fifth Massachusetts Cavalry.  Webber was rapidly elevated from private to sergeant.  In the 1870's Masonic and Odd Fellow Lodges for African Americans were established in Worcester.  Webber participated in these in leadership positions.  After the Hayes compromise in 1876 Webber never mentioned reconstruction or its demise in his chronicles.  Amos Webber died in 1904.  His death was reported to the weekly meeting of Post 10 Grand Army of the Republic.  Black fraternal organizations sent wreaths.  Webber had intense political and moral views.  He had been married for fifty two years.  His chronicle was largely silent about women.  He had inhabited a male world.  He understood racism.  His beliefs and actions included a persistent demonstration of equality"

For those who are using myth intuitively, her book will pump up the imagination. For those whose stories do not have a mythical dimension, her book is a must read.Chris Jackson does not just theorize. She takes her examples from the classic and bestseller lists:  Agatha Christie, Dorothy Sayers, Sue Grafton, Barbara Parker, Patricia Cornwell, Lisa Scottoline, Nancy Cohen and many others. She shows how the stick-to-the-ribs qualities of stories from these authors derive from artistic understanding of things such as mythic time, magic and transformation, search for identity and rites of passage.And more amazing still, most of the great examples of myth were worked out by the ancient Greeks. It is interesting to learn that what is propelling our best mystery stories today  comes from themes that were perfected around  campfires during ancient centuries"

As dawn breaks, Daniel's father, a bookseller, takes him on his first visit to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a secret, maze-like library which preserves books \\""no longer remembered by anyone, books that are lost in time.\\"" Each person who visits must adopt a book, guaranteeing that it will never disappear, and when Daniel sees The Shadow of the Wind, he knows it \\""had been waiting for me there for years, probably since before I was born.\\"" Captivated by this book by Julian Carax, Daniel tries to find out more about its mysterious author and locate additional novels, but he discovers that some other unknown seeker is also searching for Carax's books--in order to burn them.Lovers of the Gothic romance will be handsomely rewarded by the action-filled plot, as a sensitive and loving young boy comes of age while trying to unravel the mysteries associated with the elusive Julian Carax. A ghostly apparition in the misty lamplight, a faceless man who seems to have an inordinate interest in Daniel, a sadistic police inspector, and an incarnation of the devil himself all materialize as Daniel begins his search for information about Carax. Heavy, sensual imagery creates a sense of foreboding, while night-time mists, storms, and winter cold add atmosphere to sensational scenes and coincidences. A mysterious photograph, letters which go astray, false identities, an abandoned mansion with a sobbing ghost, a matricide, an evil stepfather, thwarted love, mysterious disappearances, revenge which never dies, and murder most foul all complicate the action. The evil characters are truly villainous, Daniel and his father are truly virtuous, and the women whom Daniel and Julian Carax love are pure and true of heart.Though the novel offers a good escape, it is almost six hundred pages long. Extensive background information for virtually all the characters (and even a house) gives more information than the reader really needs, and many scenes could be compressed. Occasionally, the mood is broken by mild profanity and bathroom humor. This romance does achieve more relevance than some others, however, by being directly connected to the world of books, with a setting that reflects the political climate of Spain after the Civil War and World War II. The characters are memorable, if relatively uncomplicated, and the parallels between Daniel's coming-of-age and the story of Julian Carax offer some sense of universality to this otherwise sensational melodrama.

I am a long-time fan of the Man of steel, dating back to the original Superman movies of the seventies. In recent years, Superman has been through some tough times with a massive revision followed by a death and resurrection. And those were the good parts. Story-telling in the last five years had strayed from the original vision of Superman. Long hair? I don't think so. This collection is a true back to basics of the character that showcases the best of the Superman mythos. Tim Sale's artwork is simply perfect, capturing the time lost warmth and familiarity of Smallville and the modern marvel of the bustling big-city Metropolis. The charcaters have character, something lacking in a great deal of graphic novels. Jeph Loeb spins an interesting tale, albeit a revisited re-telling, that focuses on how the Superman characters really are. The true stand-out for me anyway was the coloring which is utterly fantastic. Bjarne Hansen deserves his cover credit. Beautiful all the way around, and a true comics masterpiece"

I am convinced that Travis Hunter is telling men to ""Be Grateful "" for what you have, not what you do not have. I am further convinced that Travis Hunter is letting all men know that we are men not because we say we are men but we are men because we act like men. I challenge all men to read this book.

Mieville has a unique, and in my opinion unequaled fantasy aesthetic - he mixes up \\""steampunk\\"" tropes with more traditional fantasy themes, along with a gothic sensibility, and a touch of a Lovecraftian sense of the macabre.New Crobuzon is a Dickensian industrialist nightmare, run by a corrupt goverment, whose edicts are carried out by the faceless and brutally effective milita. The other arm of enforcement is the threat of Remaking - a grotesque punishment where an individual is fused with parts of animals, other humans, or machines. Usually the result is a horrifying, humiliating, and painful life sentence for the victim. Needless the say, they are shunned and reviled by the normal population.The previous books include mention of various different resistances and underground organizations that exist in the city, and this book details the rising of an insurgent group, and it's circular tale that returns it to it's origin.At the same time, the book details in an indirect way the story of an ongoing war with the Empire of Tesh - mostly alluded to, until the conclusion of the story.I enjoyed this book, but it doesn't hold up quite as well as the previous offerings in the series.

It was a hoot and when I found that it was part of a series, I was hooked. This book-on-tape is (I think) the 4th or 5th in the series and assumes the reader has some key facts about the hero (Mr. Q) and the cats (Ko Ko and YumYum) that play important parts in the narrative. So, although this is considered her ""best"" book by many critics, it's probably wise to start from the begining of the series and work your way up to this one - it will all make more sense that way. Having said that, this was a fun ""read"" because the plot is tight and logical and the pace is fast. The Narrator (George Guidall - I hope I got that spelling right) is superb. He plays each voice part well and even brings life to the cats through his theatrical ""Yowwwwws"". I especially like the fact that it was unabridged - the more-common ""two cassette"" offerings cut out a lot of the chatter that makes these books so much fun. Those who have read others in the series will be surprised to find out that Qwill financially quite poor and is worried about making ends meet (something that get's resolved in later books). But the cats are in rare form and despite the money woes, Mr. Q manages to spoil them with food fit for a king and queen. The author (Lillian Jackson Braun) peppers her prose with interesting facts about pottery, food, wine and life. And she manages to bring everything together in the end - tied neatly with string and a bow. I suggest you find the earlier books and get started on a series that has endured for years and will bring you pleasure for years to come"

The author has adequately reflected her thoughts into a real world of SQA with very fine illustration of the implementation aspects in the organization. The book should be a good reference to both students and practitioners who wish to understand the principles of software quality assurance and the challenges faced during successful implementation. Practitioners are likely to benefit more from the author's excellent illustration of examples and the discussion on the people issues in successful implementation of the Quality Management System in their organization. Chapters that will be of interest to real world SQA include Chapter 2- Managing Software Quality in an organization (excellent expression of the organization's commitment to Quality, chapter 4-Product Quality and Process Quality, chapter 5 (A sound foundation for a metrics initiative), Chapter 7. Software Configuration Management (Pitfalls in SCM), Chapters 8 (ISO 9001 - especially the insights into ISO consulting and services!!), Chapter 10-Software testing (The V model for testing phases and test process improvement framework is indeed very interesting and informative) The best part of the book which I enjoyed most was chapter 11-Careers in Quality, in which the author has so aptly brought out the role of a mentor who can help carve a career in Quality. The author's clarity in documenting the different roles for Quality professionals is really commendable.  SQA as a discipline is difficult to implement and is more engineering focused than most disciplines in development and operations.  In spite of these challenges, this book has been written to support Software Quality Assurance as an important component of software engineering activity and contains chapters that are specifically slanted towards that approach. Included are chapters on Walkthroughs and Inspections, Software Configuration Management, Software testing and Software measurement and metrics. The author also provides solid information on ISO Quality Assurance standards, SEI CMM, SEI CMMI, and PCMM, as well as on common practices followed at \\""Mature Organizations\\"".  As a textbook the coverage of every facet of SQA from why and what, to testing, metrics and its role in organizations and projects are thoroughly covered. The fact that the material is up-to-date and truly reflects the real world makes this one a must read for college level courses and more so, it prepares students for roles as practitioners. It is a classic and earns a solid 5 stars"

Readers have long been aware of his extraordinary powers of investigation in a variety of paranormal subjects, but seldom have he and his lovely wife, Sherry, composed anything as effecting as ""Miracles of a Mother's Love"". Their skill as writers is demonstrated by an ability here to address the psychic aspects of the maternal instinct in clear, dramatic language while avoiding the pitfalls of sentimentality. Whatever doubts the skeptic may have had about this phenomenon before examining their new book will be disspelled after considering the abundant anecdotal materials marshalled between its pages. I felt honored when Brad asked me to contribute my own little account last year. But I did not imagine at the time that he and Sherry would have been able to so beautifully synthesize such a wide variety of materials into so coherant and eminently credible a presentation. The metaphysical link between mothers and their children both describe not only validates that unseen, powerful link as nothing else in the literature: By validating such a spiritual relationship, they provide firm ground for the credibility of additional psychic phenomena. The true-life stories Brad and Sherry share with us simultaneously touch our minds and hearts, by instilling a sense or wonder that irresistably leads on to further considerations about the nature of the human soul, while touching our instinctual capacity for human compassion, as most dearly expressed in our mother's love. ""Miracles of a Mother's Love"" is, of course, the ideal gift for this or any other Mother's Day. But you'll never go wrong with this book at any other time of the year!"

As a fan of many Victorian novelists, I was curious what so-called secrets and mysteries Daniel Pool would uncover.  \\""Dickens' Fur Coat and Charlotte's Unanswered Letters\\"" may not be an appropriate title since Pool covers much more ground than just these two authors; he examines the rise of the novel in England during the nineteenth century with great care and thoroughness.While Pool does focus a great amount of time on the writings of Dickens and Charlotte Bronte (and briefly on her sisters) this book is not just a mere examination of authors.  Mixed in with the mini-biography, and gossip-page fodder scandals these authors created, is the detailed explanation of the popularity of the novel.  Pool iterates the progress novels made from three-decker behemoths to readily available cheap one-volume novels.  Another way that the popularity of novels expanded in England was due to serialization; the publishing of novels in installments in literary magazines made these stories available to a wider audience in an age when novels could only be accorded as a luxury to the richest society members.Throughout the course of the book, readers are treated to mini-biographical sketches of writers such as Trollope, Thackerary, Hardy, Henry James, and George Eliot.  These sketches are intermingled with almost too much information at times and the book is supplemented with numerous pictures.  At times it seems as if Pool is trying to cram too much information into too little space; and sometimes it seems as if the same information is being repeated with no overall plan as to the direction of his writing.  However, \\""Dickens' Fur Coat and Charlotte's Unanswered Letters\\"" is a delightful read for any fan of Victorian novelists, or novels and the rise of literature in general"

Kennedy,Books,5.0,2.0,2.0,A book of remembered hopes and dreams,"The assassination of Robert Kennedy was one of the greatest tragedies of modern history. For everyone that was alive in 1968, there is always the haunting question of what might have been. There was something about Robert Kennedy that touched the soul of America. In the final years of his life he had a genuine compassion and concern for others; and a vision of hope for America. That compassion was always there when he reached out to touch others; and they reached back to touch him. Robert Kennedy's vision is exemplified in this book, which was compiled by his youngest son. The book is divided into sections, with each section covering a different area and quality of life. The book is filled with quotations and thoughts that inspired Robert Kennedy, and helped to shape his mind and heart. There are also some of the thoughts and speeches given by Robert Kennedy. Reading the very moving quotations and inspiring thoughts contained in this book, I felt that in the end the assassin's bullets did not prevail after all. The best thoughts and ideals that Robert Kennedy represented are still with us today. So many years have passed since 1968, but perhaps it is still possible to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world. This is a book of remembered hope from the past, and a deep wish for a better world in the future"

The defending co-National Champions have a dynasty on their hands. They could very possibly win two or three National Championships in a row.   USC's last two recruiting classes were ranked number one in America, and the 2004 crop is thought to be the best in history. Not since the 1983 Nebraska Cornhuskers has a team entered the season with so many highlights. Therein lies the problem.  USC is the hottest ticket in America's hottest town, the toast of Hollywood, the biggest thing in a media hothouse. They set the all-time USC attendance record in 2003 and will likely break that in 2004.   Based upon history, one is increasingly impressed with USC. Five years ago, a Top 25 listing of the Greatest College Football Programs of All-Time would have shown USC to have slipped. However, in light of their National Championship last year and favored status to repeat this year, Troy is now back to its second place status, poised to assault Notre Dame for the top spot in the next 10 to 15 years.  Long dynasties are hard to come by in college football, but SC has a long history of doing just that. It is for this reason, combined with the glow of being Notre Dame's biggest rival, its great inter-city tradition with UCLA, and a history that goes back farther than almost any program (Michigan and Notre Dame are the only schools that go back as far and are still powers) that Southern California is not just second all-time in football but first among all athletic programs (and first by a wide margin in baseball).  The Greatest College Football Team in history is generally considered to be John McKay's 1972 Trojans. In addition, SC claims the best single-season team in the 1920s (1928) and '30s (1931). They are considered the best team of the decade of the 1930s,1960s, 1970s, and now the 2000s.  Further proof of SC's ability to maintain a tradition is their consistency. The top dynasty period in history was the John McKay/John Robinson era lasting from the early 1960s until the 1980s. The Howard Jones \\""Thundering Herd\\"" teams of the 1920s and '30s also ranks highly. Among the best three-year periods ever, none is better than SC's run from 1972-74. Among 5/6-year periods, consider three of Troy's eras (1967-72, the best of anybody, followed by 1974-79 and 1928-32).   The best 10/15-year period? USC from 1967 to 1979, but that is not all. Also ranked is the period 1962-72 and 1928-39. Among great long-term dynasties (20/25 years), nobody beats Southern California from 1962-81, when they won five National Championships and four Heisman Trophies. The Trojans easily have the most professionals, the most first round draft picks, the most Hall of Famers, the most Pro Bowlers and the most All-Americans. They are, undisputably, a football factory. The empirical evidence cannot be argued against.   On top of all this, USC counts the most Major League baseball players, the most baseball Hall of Famers, the most All-Stars and various dominant players. Despite not being known for basketball, a disproportianate number of Trojans from the 1940s and '50s are considered hoops pioneers. The \\""triangle offense\\"" was invented at SC, and such stalwarts as Bill Sharman, Alex Hannum and Tex Winter played together before induction in Springfield. USC also boasts the most Olympians, the most Olympic champions, and if they had been a country in 1976, they would have placed third in total medals at the Montreal Games"

This book is particularly poignant, with the absolute contrast of good and evil; innocence and corruption. The narrator's yearnings for the days of the ice cream factory come across beautifully as a metaphor for the opposing cold and heat in the book. The author gives us a slab of concrete that housed the making of something soft and delicious and happy; and ended up holding dead shreds of meat and hot oil and horror and unhappiness; and death.  An important book on many levels: individual; communal; corporate; personal; and political. Glad to have a new book by this vitally sensitive American writer"

More Like Manipulated,"For egomaniac Admiral Alexander York, having regular children just isn't good enough. Although such tampering is illegal in the Technocracy, York has his unborn children genetically altered. The result: Samantha is blond, beautiful, athletic and brilliant. When she is grown, she becomes ambassador to the Mandasar on the planet Troyen. Edward is also blond, handsome and athletic, but he is slow mentally. Slower than normal. An embarrassment to his father, Edward is kept out of sight until the Admiral is able to get him commissioned in the ""Expendables"" and assigned to Sam as her bodyguard. In this position, he can be kept under Sam's supervision. But, when civil war breaks out on Troyen, Sam and the Mandasar hive-queen are killed. All humans are immediately evacuated. Edward finds himself manning a lonely observation outpost on a barren moon in the Troyen system for the next twenty years. Then things start to get interesting...HUNTED is set in the same universe as Gardner's earlier books. I read the first of these, EXPENDABLE, several years ago. I thought it was OK, but not entertaining enough to look for its follow-ups. Recently, however, HUNTED caught my eye and I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did. The story is fun and well-paced, with plenty of action and lots of twists and turns. The characters are an intriguing bunch, including the likable Edward and, from previous ""expendables"" tales, Festina Ramos and Phylar Tobit. Edward, who is not as dumb as most people think, handles the trials and tribulations that come his way with an engaging degree of acceptance and humor. He isn't ""hunted"" much, though. He's manipulated endlessly, but he spends only a brief time early in the book ""on the run"". The Mandasars and other aliens are interesting, and one of the regrets I felt about this story is that they weren't developed more. The ""bad guys"" are perhaps too unrelentingly evil and uncomplicated, but the story doesn't dwell much on them, either. This IS ""space opera"" after all, not high literature. As ""space opera"", it works well enough.I've never been a big fan of sci-fi that relies on special psych powers, either among humans or aliens. It always strikes me as a cop-out when it becomes the ""out"" from the complications posed in the plot of a story. There is an element of that in HUNTED, but it doesn't intrude until the very end. I would have liked the story better without it, but it isn't a major distraction.I liked this book. It wasn't deep, but it didn't profess to be. It was fun and never got boring. A little predictable? Maybe, but the complications kept coming fast enough to raise new questions. I recommend it to fans of this genre. It is one of the best books of this type I've read in recent years.oesn't dwell much on them, either. This IS ""space opera"" after all, not high literature.

He was the one character in ""The Witch of Blackbird Pond"" that, when Kit came unexpectedly, was not the least bit pleased, nor was he ashamed to express it. I think that Spear did a tremendous job showing Mathew's personality and true character. One of the events which I thought best represented Mathew was in the beginning of the book, he looked Kit right in the eye and ""Laid down the laws"" about her wearing such horrendous clothing. On the other hand, there were a couple of events which changed my perspective on Mathew Woods' character. One includes, when Mathew decided not to go on the witch hunt. I thought thought that it was an interesting change of events. Over all, if I were to rate the character of Mathew Wood on a scale from 1-10 I would give him an 8.     There were many moods which created ""The Witch of Blackbird Pond"". My favorite of all of the moods through out the book had to be the intensity. If you think back to the book, you will recall many, very intense moments. One of them includes, when Kit was on trial for being a witch, which had to have been my personal favorite. I hear my heart beating while reading that part. Another very intense moment was when the witch hunt was going on. My eyes were glued to the pages during the section of the book. I think that the way Spear creates the mood in this story best represents her a writer. I would give the mood of the story a 10 if I were to rate it on a scale from 1-10"

The book begins with two widowers falling in love and  marrying-- and through a fascinating variety of emotional twists and  turns-- their adult children must find a way to accept their new roles in a  changing family unit.    Ms Seidel explores with richness and texture the  intrinsic complexity of two very different families coming together into a  single unit.  She probes into the unrealized 'roles' each has filled within  their own family that have never before been explored. Each character is  forced to examine who they are, and what they want as an individual--and  what they ultimately bring to the 'familial' table.  You'll experience  along with them the tentative steps toward individual growth, and  acceptance of the unique bond that comes from being part of a family  unit--even a blended family.  This book has it all. Love. Romance. Complex  relationships, including sibling rivalry at it's finest and most furious.

It is the summer of 1965. The rage of frustrated black people in Los Angeles has erupted into an orgy of looting and violence that has left the entire city in a state of frightened vigilance. The police ask Easy to look into the death of Nola Payne, nicknamed Little Scarlet. She is black woman who may have been killed by a white man. Police Commissioner Gerald Jordan wants the investigation to be conducted with tact and subtlety in order to prevent a flare-up of the rioting. Easy takes the case and he begins to make discreet inquiries into the circumstances surrounding Nola Payne's death. He places himself in danger from the woman's killer, from some members of the police department who do not want a black man treading on their turf, and from some neighborhood folks who think he should just butt out of matters that do not concern him. \\""Little Scarlet\\"" is a mood piece more than a mystery. Mosley captures the speech cadences, the gritty vernacular, the jittery atmosphere, and the despair in Los Angeles during that horrible summer. Yet Mosley keeps the proceedings light with his wry sense of humor, and he also fills the book with colorful characters, such as Raymond \\""Mouse\\"" Alexander. Mouse is a man who dresses like a clown, has a reputation as a stone cold killer, but whose help is invaluable when Easy needs information and backup. Easy Rawlins is the centerpiece of \\""Little Scarlet,\\"" and he is charismatic, charming, compassionate, and real. Easy loves his girlfriend, Bonnie, but he admits that other beautiful women catch his eye all the time. Although he could give in to the temptations that other men are prey to, Easy usually thinks things through and makes a decision based on what his gut tells him is right or wrong. Mosley's descriptive writing is magnificent. He brings every scene to life with figurative language that is both precise and imaginative. He also brilliantly explores the evils of racism and the poisonous effects of self-hatred. Easy knows that there are no quick answers to the myriad problems that plague society, but he believes that one person, if he really cares, can do his share to make things a little bit better.e and imaginative.

He lives in Marseilles, France, with the Gypsies who rescued him from the car crash in which his parents died. He carries fake Moroccan papers and he's not sure who or what he really is. His specialty is stealing car radios and he is very good at it. He has a brief shot at happiness when he is to be engaged to Lila, but then, at the engagement party, he is arrested, and soon he will be deported as an illegal alien.Where will he be sent? Why, Morocco of course, a land he has never visited and knows nothing about. The government has thoughtfully provided a ""humanitarian attache"" to accompany Aziz and help him get settled in his ""homeland."" So far, strange enough, but now things quickly get stranger and stranger. Asked to identify his home town he is forced to invent one, and the two of them set out earnestly trying to find it.From the first page, the author makes it clear that he is not dealing in ordinary reality. This is a mythic book, a surrealistic allegory about identity. A person is nothing more or less than the stories he tells about himself, so it seems to be saying, stories that may be based in reality or made up out of whole cloth. Maybe even stories that belong to someone else. Author Cauwelaert explores this concept in flowing, readable prose.Although the story begins in delightful absurd whimsy, it gradually becomes more somber, more convoluted, more self-consciously significant. In fact, it begins to drag. Although One-Way is a short book, it was a bit of an effort for me to finish it. I would recommend it with some reservations, a novel that is enjoyable, intriguing, but flawed. Reviewed by Louis N. Gruber"

53087372,R36UNYV9ZM85EC,0224068407,932008693,Kelly and Victor,Books,3.0,0.0,0.0,"Lust, lager, loneliness in Liverpool","A couple of characters from Griffith's previous epic of Welsh druggies circa 1995, Grits, appear in cameos in this Liverpudlian narrative. Its relative compression--about 40% less than Grits and with two main characters rather than eight or so. The fact that they both speak the same dialect also helps the pace and depth of this novel. As the millennium strikes popularily in 2000 (if not calendarically), Victor finds himself immediately taken, in more ways than one, by Kelly. We find out first his side of the story, then hers. Details from her narrative fill in gaps left from his perspective, and the result gives what for readers of Griffiths other fiction are again visits to the DSS, gripes about the consumerist lifestyle, and ennui interspersed with not so much chemical but hormonal charges.This shift from hundreds of pages of drug-fueled states of consciousness to a couple of a hundred focused more upon sex does move the plot along more quickly and less sullenly than that of Grits. As with the earlier novel, poignant moments are few but effectively rendered against a harsh, noisy, and brutal city landscape. The two cathedrals of Liverpool tower over the characters symbolically and literally as Kelly and Victor scramble to keep their footing in an increasingly tense relationship with one another and with their surroundings.After reading Sheepshagger, Grits, and Kelly + Victor, I'm still left curious if Griffiths can convey other milieux as effectively as he can that of these often intelligent but determinedly scamming and disenfranchised young. I must admit that given pages of effectively captured but numbingly cumulative monologue and dialogue--with their scrounging and complaining about the injustice of it all--his characters are only too eager to keep living off of the welfare paid them by others caught up in their own mundane, if often less chemically sustained, drab jobs. Certainly his characters find enough income to keep their alcohol and pharmaceutical intake steady.This distance, then, from his often articulate but stubbornly willful layabouts does diminish this reader's sympathy for their plight. Perhaps this is part of Griffith's more subtle message, but I suspect that he considers himself a voice for the voluntarily proleteriat rather than their humanist critic. While I empathize with many of his characters' ideological rants more often than not, their repeated refusal to act upon their raised consciousness makes for a frustrating encounter with so many partially educated but stubbornly lazy sods.

It's more of a mystery with a big dose humor thrown in.  It's the story of three very different women who meet in the Raymond Carmichael's hospital room.  The problem is that each of these women thinks she's Raymond's wife.  Raymond is murdered shortly thereafter, and his three wives are the chief suspects.  Each of the wives are very different, and you will find Ruby absolutely hilarious.  The interaction among the three is always amusing.

Thanks to competition you can get more products and services at a cheaper price than you ever could.  The dark side of this 24/7 consumer society, is that it is also a ruthless 24/7 workaholic society.  The U.S. is a wonderful place to be rich (ideally financially independent).  But, it is an increasingly competitive place to make a living.  In other words, the U.S. is a consumer's paradise, but often a supplier's hell.Reich develops great metaphors to describe working people in few words.  One of them is the Geeks and the Shrinks.  The Geeks are the ones who know how to gather and manipulate data so as to develop new products and services.  The Shrinks are the ones who research and understand what consumers really want through market research, focus groups, and other tools.  The Geeks and Shrinks are like the Yin and Yang of this new business world.  They both need each other to create new markets of products and services"

I was sixteen the summer Diana was married and I remember  getting up early and watching her wedding on TV with my mother, who died  five years ago. I know that this woman who wrote the book had the same  reaction to Diana as my mother did  -  that she was shy and sweet and  innocent. Reading this book takes us all back to the innocent time before  the wedding, when she forgot to wear a slip and wore the wrong dress to the  ball and avoided reporters outside her flat as she went to work each day.       The perspective of this book, though is its most iimportant part. This  woman does not boast of her relationship with Diana, which continued until  shortly before her death,  but instead is appreciative of every encounter  with the Princess, every lettter every CHristmas card.

This is a true story, based on a boy named David Pelzer, who lived in Daly City, California during the early 70's.  David was brutally abused by his mother.  It was the worst case of child abuse ever recorded in California's history.  Reading this opens your eyes to a whole different side of things.  Once the book was in my hands, I could not put it down.  It was so good, that I read it in one sitting. Some details in this story are sometimes so vivid; that you can almost feel the pain David went through.  Also, this book makes you realize that some kids are not as lucky as others are.  Once you have this book, it has you. You pick it up and don't put it down till you have finished the last page.  This is a story with so much suspense, that you want to keep reading it, to see what happens next.  Every page keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Your always wondering \\""Can it get any worse?\\"", and when you think it can't, it does.  Which in turn gives you more incentive to read further on.  Also, many surprises lurk between the pages, making it better page after page. This story is a very realilistic one. Every abusive event experienced by David is described to its fullest detail.  Some parts are so intense, it's like your sitting right there with David as he experiences all this torment and suffering.  When reading about all this pain and suffering he went through, you can somewhat feel the loneliness and reclusion that David endured through his childhood.  Also, it puts so much hatred in your heart for the person responsible for causing it all.  While reading these childhood stories of Mr. Pelzer, you sit there and think; \\""how could somebody let this happen to them\\""? I said the same thing to myself, but by the time you finish the story, all the questions you ask yourself, will be answered. This book really opens your eyes to the problem of child abuse in the United States.  It makes you realize some kids aren't as lucky as others aren't.  Like they say sometimes \\""Bad things happen to good people\\"".  Sometimes kids deserve to get punished for something they did wrong, but when they are good and get beat anyways, that's a problem.  You may have to go deeper than the surface to see the real problem.  I think this story will make people realize that others have it worse than they do.  Just because a person is good, doesn't mean their lifestyle is. The world isn't always such a good place to be.  Even though things may look normal, they can be far from it.  \\""Don't judge a book by its cover\\"".  I recommend this book to everyone.  It changes your thinking about a lot of things.  Even if reading isn't your thing, I'll bet you will like this book anyways.  All events in the story came directly from the person that experienced them first hand.  This book is only number 1 in a series of 3.  Once you read the first one, you'll want to read the other two.  In the end you will be happy you read it"

The  author introduced me to a world that I have always wanted to visit (since I  couldn't live there!).  I enjoyed the fact that I could neither love the  heroes nor hate the villians with impunity. No one is perfect, and everyone  has a history as to why they developed into the characters that we read  about.One of the neatest places to start a character off (especially a  young one like Talia) is a school setting.  Lackey does such a wonderful  job of setting up the Collegium, along with its students and faculty, that  I could feel myself roaming its halls and looking into the classrooms.  A  nice touch of detail: how the author sets up the school library so you can  spend as much time as you need in there, but you cannot ""check  out"" any of the material, thereby allowing everyone ready access to  the books.  The ""bad"" students may be a little too typical; but  they do provide a good foil for Talia to develop into a fighter and a sharp  intellect.As a character, Talia is a great example of what young  teenagers could do if only they are allowed (and encouraged) to think for  themselves.  She has to reap her mistakes along with the rewards; but at  least they are the result of her own actions and reactions.Strongly  recommend for anyone with a love for high fantasy, especially young folks  looking for a hero to whom they can relate"

She works part-time with problem junior high kids and has a \\""completely and utterly fine husband\\"" who has a crush on his youthful coworker and a 15-year-old son who is quickly becoming more and more distant.  And she can't forget about her first love, Ray, the college sweetheart who has consistently disappointed her for half her life.  So when Ray calls and invites Julia to go with him to the wedding of mutual friends, she figures, \\""What the hell.\\""  At the wedding, one things leads to another, and Julia finds herself perched on the sink in the bride's parents' bathroom, engaged in an impromptu tryst with Ray.  A couple of weeks later, she realizes she's pregnant...and, wouldn't you know, she's also recently had a rare sexual encounter with her husband, so she's not sure who the baby's father is.  It's hard to believe that Mary Guterson is the sister of David, author of uber-serious novels like SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS.  This novel is a rollicking read, laugh-out-loud funny and brutally honest and surprisingly poignant.  Guterson's Julia is a refreshing, tell-it-like-it-is heroine who voices the things that no one else dares say:  \\""Isn't that every woman's fantasy?  That her husband would die and leave her everything and she wouldn't have to live with him forever and put up with doing his laundry and dealing with his parents?\\""  Hilarious, outrageous moments are coupled with understated moments of tenderness and kindness, made all the more endearing by their heartbreaking honesty.  WE ARE ALL FINE HERE is a cuttingly funny, nakedly truthful, cunning, witty, wry, fresh, inventive, and irreverent look at motherhood, marriage, and friendship that can be summed up in one of the novel's wonderfully ironic statements:  \\""We are all fine and hope to hear the same from you.\\""  Written in minimalist prose, WE ARE ALL FINE HERE is a refreshing debut full of surprising insights and sweet moments, one that seeks to get below the \\""happily ever after\\"" myth and explore the real workings of contemporary marriage"

It's not bad, per se, and there are some really funny moments in it. But on the whole, it's a much darker and more serious book than the rest of the  Hitchhiker novels. It seems like Adams wrote it just to shut up the people  clamoring for another Hitchhiker book; an impression that's definitely  furthered by the ending (which, not to give too much away, makes a sequel  nearly impossible). Read it, but don't expect it to measure up to the first  four books"

On the other hand it was hard to follow, the dead character has a \\""speaking\\"" part, and there are several occurrences of deus ex machina. When the character Vardaman is introduced he has just caught a large fish and is instructed to clean it before entering the house. While he is busy doing this a major character dies and this image/act is stick in his head. Several times throughout the rest book Vardaman mentions the fish. The title and one sentence composing an entire chapter is him saying \\""My _____ is a fish.\\"" The entire Book is comprised of chapter entitled only with a characters name. That chapter will follow that characters thoughts and conversations. This allows the reader to understand what each character is feeling and why they do what they do and it also makes the book a little easier to follow because you know who's mind you are in.While this aspect makes it a little easier to understand the book some events are a little hard to follow especially the ending. At the beginning of the book Anse, who is the father of the family, gives up a set of false teeth he has been looking forward to getting, then at the end after he leaves for a short period, Anse returns with a new set of false teeth and an unexpected guest. As I mentioned before a character dies early on but about half way through the book there is a chapter where you get into their mind and can see their thoughts. This reveals a scandalous secret, and a lot about their life.One thing I several was disappointed with was the way the author would put the family in precarious situations then just allow then an easy way out. Much like the deus ex machina of the Greek story tellers. On such occurrence is an incident in which the family try to cross high flood water and even though the rapids are strong enough to carry away the mule's the family manages to catch the coffin and pull it to shore. This happens a couple more times in the text of the novel.Over all I'm glad I tried a novel by Faulkner but in speaking now with the voice of experience I would rather eat mud than do it again"

Society as a whole has had a stereotypical image that a women is supposed to be fair colored with blonde hair and blue eyes. This unwritten fact has had an impact on women, more specifically blak women. The struggle with this black girl with psychological probems reflect the struggle of everyday people. This novel is a great inspiration to ypung girls and a motivation not only to accept yourself as a whole, but but also to acceptyour individualityand independence as a women.

Ten years later, I was excited to reread the whole series, with all of the one-shots and specials included, ordered appropriately.  And... Well, I -did- enjoy the book, but was still a little disappointed by the time it had ended. I question the inclusion of \\""Blink 1-4\\"", since the vast majority of that mini-series (which sparked the start up of the 'Exiles' ongoing title) has little or nothing to do with AoA, as Clarice (Blink) is galivanting through another plane.  All in all, it was a good collection. . . But a very incomplete one. Though large in size, know ahead of time that this volume is only a single installment of the huge epic. It barely even scratches the surface, presenting you with back-story and additional pieces, without delving into the core of AoA in the least. I'm looking forward to Book 2, which I'm hoping will be a little more 'all-inclusive'"

Almost half of it is either a rehashing of what took place in earlier books or the same thing happening over and over again in this book.  The plot also does not advance much.  She spends many pages describing the imaginary scenery, which seems beautiful but not necessary to the story.  She does introduce many characters, but the character development is limited to only a select few.  Indeed, a character introduced early on who appears to be a main protagonist, is then summarily dropped except for a couple of casual mentions 400 pages later.  Finally, large spans of time are allowed to proceed without any text.  All of a sudden a whole season goes by with only 50 or so pages of text.  The book did progress the story, but the same amount of progression could have been done in 100 pages.  It feels as if this book was just filler till the next one"

It is part historical novel, part mystery, part love story - and has a strong element of the `coming of age' story about it as well, even though the central character is an adult, has been married, and is a mother.The story's narrator, Anna Frith, is a simple woman - poor, but happily married and ecstatic to be a mother.  She works as a serving woman in the house of a wealthy local family, and comes to work in the home of the new minister and his wife as well.  She finds a friend in Elinor Mompellion - the rector's wife - that she will cherish for the rest of her life, a friendship that will enrich her and change her life in ways that she could have never imagined.After the death of her husband in a mining accident, Anna takes in a lodger to help her with the few expenses of her life.  He is a tailor, and a decent man - she is happy to have found such a tenant.  When a bolt of cloth arrives for him from London, however, it carries with it the seeds of a disaster the likes of which Anna and the rest of the villagers could only envision in their worst nightmares of hell - the cloth is infested with fleas, which carry Plague.  The disease kills the tailor himself first, then insidiously spreads throughout the village, claiming the lives of over half of its inhabitants by the time it runs its course.  The story so well-told in this novel concerns the villagers trials at the hands of this demon - they are gripped by fear and preyed upon by not only their own superstitions and ignorance, but by those in their midst who would profit from their pain and suffering as well.Anna's journey - and the journey of the other villagers - through these trying times make for a very compelling read.  There are horrors to be found here, as would be expected, but there are moments of epiphany and great joy as well.  Brooks, an experienced journalist who has covered Bosnia, Somalia and the Middle East for The Wall Street Journal, has put the observational skills she has honed in that profession to good work here - even though is it set in another era, human tragedy, suffering and happiness are universal.

I found the first part of the book had some very thoughtful and intelligently argued bible scholarship, especially the chapter on the Lord's suffering in the Garden at Gesethemane (sp?), and his precise knowledge of the original Greek is formidable. As the book progresses from the events preceding up to the crucifixion, to Easter, the literary style becomes increasingly anecdotal, evangelical, and sermonized.  I found this latter part of the book rather wearing by the end. Had the scholarly tone been maintained throughout, the result would have been shorter, more cohesive, and perhaps less expensive.

Leroy is an interesting character, and the life he leads lends itself well to showing a world that I have no experience with: the poor white population of California. While this text allows for someone to sympathize with another person, a reason we read fiction, the lack of fault in Leroy begins to grow stale rather quickly. Leroy is just too ideal. His only fault was a ten year old infidelity that is also not a fault, merely a stumbling block in which he grew; it is used to show how pure the man truly is because he can not overcome the fact that he has cheated on his wife, a woman that slept around. His only other fault may be his lack of trusting his wife because of her own past, but he even overcomes that.   It is a quick read. read it; disagree with me"

My biggest concern was with the people issues; there's a lot of discussion around how to transition your company from one stage to another and how that will affect the various roles, rewards the people in those roles should expect, and even the type of work those people should be doing. I don't think -- especially for companies as people-based as technology companies -- he spends enough time talking about how you handle those issues, set expectations, and actually lead your company through these sorts of changes.

I first read Mr. Rybakov's ""Children of the Arbat"" and ""Fear"", books about young adults in 1930s Moscow, and enjoyed both very much.  Because I could not immediately find the third book of his trilogy (""Dust and Ashes""), I read ""Heavy Sand"", which my library just happened to have.This book about Jews living in the Ukraine from 1910s to 1940s is a great read.  The book is more a story about how forthrightness and integrity meant something in the days of yore, rather than a treatise about Soviet Judaism, therefore, it is totally accessable to the gentile, American reader.  ""Heavy Sand"" also does not have the superfluous, melodramatic verbage that plagues much of Russian/Soviet literature, verbage that often obstructs the point being made and makes much of Russian/Soviet literature unpalatable to most Americans.The one knock on ""Heavy Sand"" is that it was obviously tailored to pass the censors in 1970 USSR.  It doesn't dwell on Stalinist purges or pervasive anti-Semitism, which were more than prevalent at the time.  However, knowing this going in, it is an amazing, warm and inspiring book.

Haling from metropolitan NY the book had some resonance for me, and I was highly entertained by Kaplan's descriptions of a bourgeois lifestyle both familiar  and very amusing (from a distance).  Initially, I was detached reading what  I thought were descriptions of a long gone era, but abruptly realized when  reading of Will's class of 1974 high school reunion that this book was  talking about me! Accordingly thereafter the text became more pointed and I  became more personally engaged.Kaplan aptly describes the superficial  and label oriented culture culture predominant in much of suburban NY.  He  also poignantly depicts the marginal accomplishment and sense of lost  opportunity, shallow satisfactions, and sacrificed ideals this lifestyle  often represent.  The beauty of the book is that he conveys a meaningful,  thought provoking message in an entertaining fashion without being morose  or pedantic.  The book sustains a credible plot until the last quarter  in which events become increasingly fantastic and absurd.  However,  throughout it remains entertaining despite a weak ending.This is a  perfect read for middle class, middle aged, metropolitan readers"

Child served during the latter stages of the First World War as an officer with a Canadian Field Artillery battery.  Drawing from this experience, he wrote God's Sparrows, which was first published in England in 1937.  The story centres on the Thatchers, a wealthy family from \\""Wellington\\"" whose comfortable lives are thrown assunder by the outbreak of the war.  As the war progresses, and the two sons (as well as several relations) enter the service, reality as it was known disintegrates and is replaced by flux, uncertainty, and confussion.  This is most strongly seen in the relationship between the main protagonist Dan Thatcher with his brother Alistair, his cousin Quentin, and his friends Cynthia and Beatrice Elton.  Like most novels about the First World War written during the inter-war period, God's Sparrows is an anti-war novel.  Although I felt the writing to be a little awkward in parts, over all the novel was a powerful and evocative work.  It is unfortunate that this work has slipped into obscurity as its message is still quite relevant.

The sex and the tension in this one and the tremendous impact of the sex scenes is visceral. I love it when Keely tempts Noah with some voyeuristic thrills then takes them herself when it pushes him over the edge....their passion at a Vegas wedding against the glass looking down on a hotel lobby again has these fantasy elements that bring the heart rate up! I need to get a new copy because I find myself doing as I did at 13 and dogearring the good parts to read over again!  Kudos to Harlequin for continuing to stretch and push the element of women's fiction! The strong sexual content of the Blaze books, the action packed Intimate Moments line, the emotional Special Editions and the ever good Desire and Temptation lines just keep getting better. People forget that most of the big names in women's fiction all got their start in series romance- today with all of the options available in the series there is room for so many styles it is the readers who really win!  And the Harlequin Blaze line esp as written by Ms Lewis Thompson is about as good as vanilla porn ( the Jennifer Crusie term from Welcome to Temptation) can get!"

I am sure that by adopting several of the concepts management will increase the chances of success.  However the basic tenant of this plus the previous book - \\""Built to Last\\"" I take fundamental issue with.  I don't believe that the fine distinction between companies such as P&G and GE - not great according to Collins and Walgreens and Gillette considered great is meaningful.  Surely P&G and GE are great companies - especially over the long term.  Collins tends to take a short term financial view - taking a maximum of 20 years performance.  There is only one company considered to be in the top 100 companies in 2004 that was there is 1917 - GE.  With regard to the basic concepts I found the most useful to be \\""First Who...Then What\\"" and \\""The Hedgehog Concept\\"". I don't agree with the \\""Level 5 Leadership\\"" of shy and self effacing people.  In my experience the best leaders have charisma, charm, a sense of humour and are eternally optimistic - these characteristics are much more important than being humble, reserved and quiet.  \\""The Culture of Discipline\\"" is of course important but \\""Execution\\"" by Bossidy and Charan covers this subject in more depth and with more tangible recommendations.  Here's an alternative approach - maybe someone should study the behaviours that have lead to the worst performance of companies over the past 20 years; it could be called \\""Bad to Worst\\"". I think there is far more to learn from mistakes and how to improve on poor performance - maybe the best way to be Great is too learn most from the worst!!"

Georgia and Ray die in a tragic car accident, leaving behind their one-year-old daughter Keefer. Georgia's adopted brother Gordon McKenna wants to adopt Keefer, believing it would fulfill his sister's dying wishes. Unfortunately, his wealthy in-laws also wish to adopt Keefer.Legal wrangling raise the issues of what constitutes a \\""blood relative\\"" when Gordon's adoption request is initially dismissed because he is an adopted relative rather than a blood relative. When Keefer goes to life with her father's family, the typical differences in culture, religion and parenting style will echo the nightmares of any parent who lost custody of their child. Tragically, the best interest of the child becomes secondary to the letter of the law, and the needs of the survivors.Readers expecting a dramatic fight complete with courtroom drama will be disappointed. But readers expecting a carefully crafted, character-driven drama that reveals the foibles, challenges and fears related to changing family dynamics will find their expectations richly rewarded. Life-like details reveal the devastation left by grief and desperation, as young Keefer becomes the symbol of survival for two families. Selfish need replaces the best interests of the child in a poignantly tragic way even as love struggles for supremacy. The themes of judgments made based upon the letter of the law rather than its spirit will strike the heart of any parent caught in a custody battle as well as those that concern adoption issues. A remarkably heart rendering novel, A THEORY OF RELATIVITY comes highly recommended"

She chose to \\""expose\\"" (as I like the way one reviewer stated it) a subject that the Christian community avoids like the plague. She didn't write this enlightening story from a judgmental point, but rather an eye-opening point of view and she did it as such to keep the reader's attention. The cover of the book said that it was a \\""Knots Landing waiting to happen.\\""  I couldn't agree more.  I'm from the Knots Landing, Dallas and Dynasty era.  This book portrayed such complexed and sexually driven characters that one would have to think that hmmmmmm...maybe there is a perverted spirit lurking in these people.  It makes you even check your own self to see if there may be one lying within you if you are sexually active and promiscuous. It all started with Big Blue.  He knew that he had a lot of perverted spirits in him because he went to a psychic and she told him.  He was the father of two girls and a boy and also the father of a set of illegitimate twins.  His one daughter was a prostitute and his son was homosexual.  The twin girl...well, I'll let you read that part, and the twin boy...well that's another really good part that you'll enjoy reading.  I don't want to give the story away.  Then there's a teenager name Ellee.  She is the most twisted, sexually promiscuous teenager I have ever seen.  You know she got a sex demon in her.  But Ben is totally possessed with a high craving for sex.  He is so twisted in his mind until you almost feel sorry for him.  These sexual spirits jump from flesh to flesh.To sum it all up, this book is the alter ego of ZANE's books.  The essence of it all is this:  be careful who you sleep with because he or she might have a sex demon and \\""give it to you.\\""  Some people think that its good to have a high sex drive, but you can catch all kinds of diseases as the author stated in her book if you have multiple partners.  She's only tellin you what Aretha Franklin says:  \\""You Better Think!\\""There are so many things that you will learn and enjoy about Lust of the Flesh.

This is almost a unique talent, to be able to basically detail one conversation after another and make it exciting is no small feat. This book details out the political action committees, special interest groups and lobbyists in their rather unseemly pursuit of gaining favor and influence with the only group of people that actually get paid to spend half of their time begging for money, Congressmen. The book details out what took place in the 1996 elections, not from the point of view of the politicians, but from the point of view of the people who are paid to bribe, sorry I mean influence the politicians.         Even though I have read a great number of books about modern politics, this was the first time I read a whole book detailed to this part of the Soft Money generation process. You almost feel like you need a shower after each chapter of this book. The non stop cajoling and sweat talking these guys and gals had to do was just a bit sickening. I guess it is like the old saying about sausage, it is great to eat but you do not what to watch it being made. About the only redeeming quality these special interest people had was that they really did come off in the book to be committed to whatever was there group. I guess it may be the only way to be successful in that type of job.         The author spent most of her time focusing on the Republican races and mostly conservative groups. The author explained that this focus was due to the fact that the Democrats held the White House and she wanted to focus on the challengers. This made sense to me, but the dirt she digs up on the way these people do business tends not to leave them in a good light. Given that she focuses mostly on the Republicans, it does seem to give the impression that the book is somewhat bias. Then again maybe it was just me as I tend not to be a big fan of rather right leaning groups, but like to read balanced books. Overall was my only concern with the book. The book was well written and very informative. It is a wonderful item to add to your collection and really opens your eyes to just how unattractive fund raising is"

The emphasis is on support for newer SQL features such as triggers and stored procedures that make DB2 an ""object-relational"" system.   The book, which is replete with tips and examples,  is useful both as a reference and a how-to guide.  I would not recommend this book for beginners, i.e., those without some hands-on experience with a relational Database Management System; although the book is clearly written, the subject matter covered is broad and necessarily compressed, even within 682 pages.

It definitely will not be my last. Great book. Started out a little slow but I was completely drawn in as soon as Gaby McAshlan hit the Chaga. A great read on its own merits but I was drawn philosophically as well. The conflict between Western civilizations (UN) trying to manipulate the outcome in 3rd world countries (Africa) was compelling. Especially in light of a situation that seems like an inevitable occurrence on the entire planet. When I thought about the alternative of the Western world doing nothing, unfortunately, that was equally plausible. The fact that the novel takes place in the near future made it very easy to visualize. I thought that the bulk of the sex and romance in the story was mostly gratuitous and McDonald did not flesh out some of the more interesting characters. I found Gaby's roommate Miriam Sondhai to be a very interesting character and wanted to learn more about her . I thought the ending with Gaby's lover Shepard in space was a little much as well, although I did enjoy the descriptions of the conditions in space and would like to know just what he saw when he went into the Big Dumb Object.

The very vocal reparations proponents don't want dialogue on this issue.  Mr. Horowitz's book not only leaves no other choice BUT to initiate dialogue on reparations...it also shows us WHY reparations proponents don't want it discussed.  The mere fact that the book has stirred up reparations proponents like a nest of hornets...shows us how scared they are of the logic and truth that true dialogue will reveal.

I think this is a two star book on its own demerits. The book felt very long as I was reading it. Most of the characters are just \\""there.\\"" Sure, things go on with them, but if any one subplot was missing, it would not affect the outcome of the book at all. Also, the end of the book let me down very much. It felt like he reached his limit of pages and just drew it to a close as quickly as he could. The rest of the story was so drawn out and protracted, then in the span of a few pages it's resolved. It's hardly proper payoff for reading through the preceeding 200 pages.

But when her real mother returns offering Wise Child a life of leisure, will Wise Child go with her and forget Juniper's kindness?I will only comment on this because others have: When I first read the book, I did not detect the Paganism implications.  If it would bother you for such to be implied, you might not even notice.

I think it depends on ones taste about which of them are worth or not but there is at least ONE story that can make you loose your breath, or at least make you think about losing it..  The self titled story is amazingly tough sensitive and unique, no writer ever experiments with matters like these (some would say because they are trivial matters perhaps).He writes about derranged situations, but with perfect realism.  He is a unique writer. He is probably one of the sharpest minds alive but still..... this book may not be good enough for you. No conservative thought is allowed in the world of Will Self and some of the readers are probably going to hate him for exposing their taboos...  The manual about the VOLVO car is the best short story i have ever read.

In this book, Gould himself speaks to the importance of this function, and eloquently defends the value of this sort of work.  As usual, he approaches the subject obliquely, starting off with an analysis of the literary and musical achievements of Gilbert and Sullivan!

Originally published in Philadelphia in 1765, this recounts the little-known events surrounding the military campaign led by Swiss-born Colonel Henry Bouquet against the Shawnee, Wyandot, Mingo, and Delaware Indians in the Ohio Country during the closing days of Pontiac's Rebellion. After the Ottawa chief Pontiac laid seige to the English forts on the western frontier following France's defeat in the Seven Years War, Col. Bouquet was sent with Lt. Col. John Bradstreet on a dangerous two-pronged campaign to punish and break the Indians, thus forcing them into submission and the acceptance of English rule. Bradstreet's march into northern Ohio and Michigan was a farce, ending with Bradstreet disobeying his orders in an attempt to make a name for himself by \\""single-handedly\\"" ending the Rebellion. Despite this, Bouquet marched from Fort Pitt, and after a desperate council with the hostile tribes at the forks of the Muskingum River near Coshocton, secured their allegiance of peace. The outcome of this peace was the handing over of all white prisoners from the war, a heart-rending affair for many as the captives had been adopted into the tribes and many young children, and even some adults, were forcibily removed from their adoptive Indian families to be returned to white society.

The reader is immersed in the details of a scheme by one of the world's largest agricultural companies, ADM, to control prices on a variety of essential products. Not expecting a mole in their midst, they proceed to fix prices with their global counterparts. While ADM schemes to commit a [...] on the general public, there is a scheme afoot to [...] ADM.The book starts out depicting the informant as a great humanitarian who acts out of altruistic goals. As the tale of the Informant proceeds to unfold, we are no longer sure who the good guys and bad guys are. Worse still, at the end of the book, there are many questions as to the appropriateness of the way in which the government deals with the various participants.Comparisons have been made with A Civil Action. While both are true stories of major litigation, the Informant does not have the excitement of A Civil Action, where the lawyers risk everything to obtain justice. In the Informant, there is no such risk as the large law firms and the government lawyers are getting paid their hourly rates, regardless of the outcome. Nonetheless, the Informant is a very worthwhile and enjoyable read for its insights into the territorial conflicts between the various sections of Federal law enforcement"

It was under such circumstances that George Washington, his battles won and his military work done, began his well-deserved trip home in time for the holidays.Stanley Weintraub, author of several books on military history, renders a most moving portrait in GENERAL WASHINGTON'S CHRISTMAS FAREWELL. Indeed, it does move, taking the reader from the battlefields of the east to the ""greatest man's"" home and family in Mount Vernon, Virginia. Having led his troops in victory over the British forces, the future president was the object of high approbation, bordering on worship. There were those among the founding fathers who would have made Washington king of the new nation, but he declined, declaring that the new nation would have no monarchy. (A pale modern-day comparison might be a sports figure legend like Cal Ripken, Jr., bidding goodbye to fans in each stadium during his final season.) Weintraub follows the slow, emotional journey made by Washington and his entourage, through New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, on their way to Philadelphia, the seat of the colonial Congress at the time. It was there, in settings most formal, that the general relinquished his commission. The author often compares Washington to the Roman general Cincinnatus, who, like his latter-day counterpart, looked forward to laying down his sword and returning to his lands. Washington's patriotism had come at great personal sacrifice, including financial ""inconvenience,"" although he steadfastly refused any payment other than ""expenses.""What sets GENERAL WASHINGTON'S CHRISTMAS FAREWELL apart from similar books about the father of our country is its depth of emotion. The affection and admiration in which Washington was held by his officers, soldiers and the general citizenry were unparalleled. Weintraub writes of tears shed unabashedly as Washington delivered his famous farewell address, and of the great man's similar difficulties in maintaining composure.The author has done his homework well, as befits an Evan Pugh Professor Emeritus of Arts and Humanities from Penn State University. In addition to items of importance, he includes bits of the seemingly trivial --- such as the costs of room and board --- which help put the times in perspective as well as add a note of levity.With modern America's penchant for taking many of its gifts for granted, Weintraub has done well to remind readers of the early price of their current overall social and political well-being.   --- Reviewed by Ron Kaplan"

From the first page, Banks' writing reels you in with a mysterious storyline and almost lyrical prose.  The ease at which he takes something so commonplace as a bridge and turns it into something out a nightmare that perhaps showed up in the dreams of Kafka is almost frightening.  The entire novel exudes strangeness, with odd events happening and everyone taking them for granted.Banks dreams up a plausible culture that would live on an enormous bridge and takes us through page by page.  Given, some of the parts are extremely odd and hard to read (the parts with the monologue in Scottish come to mind), but they only add to the ultimate mystery of the book: who is John Orr and what is the Bridge?  I recommend that everyone try to figure it out.  An excellent novel"

The book looks at the 100 most common miscenceptions and debunks each one. Some of them are fairly trivial, but interesting, such as the belief that the forbidden fruit in Eden was an apple.  (The Bible doesn't say what it was.)  But some are pretty important, such as the common belief that \\""Thou shalt not kill\\"" prohibits capital punishment and war.  (Most newer translations, as the book explains, are more correct in using \\""murder\\"" instead of \\""kill.\\"")  The book even tackles the common belief that the Bible is anti-environment.  Some of the chapters are short, barely a page, and on the whole the book is an easy read, even in places where there is some fairly technical data on the meanings of Greek and Hebrew words"

What's the rush?  Grisham follow's Pappy's pace in the first part of the book, finds the accellerator in the middle, and coasts home at the end.  At times the reader is charmed by the sly and ironic narrative of Luke Chandler, a seven year old future St. Louis Cardinal.  At times the reader is hooked into nail-biting intensity as two rival villains develop.  The rest of the journey is about as exciting as watching paint dry.  Overall, I recommend this book.  We must encourage Grisham to get out of the court room.  He demonstrates a skill beyond mere litigators.  This is especially true with the narrator's sweetness,  reminding me of moments from ""To Kill A Mockingbird.""  The big difference between this novel and the Atticus Finch classic is the ending, Grisham's Achilles heal.  While there is some satisfaction, at least four major characters and one disaster are too easily set aside or left hanging.  True, we can all imagine their fates.  But the page count is light enough that a couple knots could have been tied.  That would bring this effort 'Cliff Notes' status.  Keep experimenting, Mr. Grisham.

On the one hand she purports to be a staunchly independent \\""feminist\\"", and yet she is utterly desperate for a man to call her own.  In point of fact, Bridget and her other unattached cronies are all convinced that they'll die alone and will be discovered weeks later half-eaten by an Alsatian.  This desperation tends to drive Bridget into relationships with some real sleazebag losers, which, while doing nothing helpful for her self-esteem, does wonders for her dieting.  Add to all this the fact that Bridget has finally reached that difficult point in life where she has to be the adult in her family.  She has to handle her dad's pitiful middle-of-the-night phone calls while her mum, who left home in the throes of an end-of-life crisis, plays at living a wild carefree life as a television personality with a new youngish boyfriend, all the while trying to throw Bridget at her neighbor's rich, newly-divorced barrister son.  What worked for me: I totally relate to Bridget's neuroses concerning food and calorie counting, as I imagine millions of other women in the world do.  I also understand her worries about fitting into the world and trying so hard to present herself as someone who \\""belongs\\"" appearance and intelligence-wise.  Bridget's attempts at self-improvement in those areas were funny but also terribly bittersweet.  Though it sometimes seemed a bit much, the terse telegraphic writing style lent itself very well to giving the feel of reading someone else's journal.

Size-wise Bridget was at best on the plump side of average, but she felt as though she was much larger than that.

Lewin, Lamentations (Evanston Publishing, 1993)Thank you, Oscar Wilde, for having the stones to say something that allows the rest of us to quote you and thus not come off sounding like such hard-hearted bastards: \\""all bad poetry is sincere.\\"" The problem with reviewing (much less critiquing) bad poetry is that it makes the reviewer, oft-times, feel like an ogre. You pick up a book full of thoroughly awful verse about a topic that it would be heresy to bash. There are an awful lot of bad poems about rape, child molestation, and other such light and airy topics; one need not look far to find a thousand examples. In this case, your obstreperous, bullheaded reviewer is going to take on one hundred twenty-eight pages written by Dr. Roger A. Lewin about the death of his wife and the effect it had on him and his two-year-old daughter. And, so I don't sound like too much of an ogre, let me, dear reader, gently remind you of Wilde's quote, and say that denigration of the work is not denigration of the inspiration of the work.Roger Lewin is a psychiatrist. Roger Lewin is also an exceptionally bad poet. I have no idea if these two things are combined, but I suspect that, at least in Lewin's case, it is. Lewin manages to flaunt all the rules of what makes good poetry, sometimes all of them in a single poem. We have expressionless laundry lists of verbs, we have telling and not showing, bad puns, little psychological tricks, the whole painful mess of teen angst. Which might be forgivable if Lewin were still a teen; one does not want to make assumptions regarding his age, but his late wife would have been forty-nine when the book was published; thus, one guesses his teen days are relatively far behind him. Growing up and gaining life experience has not made the man a better poet.In the great tradition of \\""I don't know art, but I know what I like,\\"" a few examples of what I'm talking about above:\\""The rangeof verbsis too narrowto namemy horrifiedacquiescencein your demise.\\""(\\""Autumn Voice\\"")Let me point out the piquancy of word choice here, and say that I have never before seen the phrase \\""horrified acquiescence\\"" in a poem. And I hope to never see it in a poem again. (As you may be able to guess from the first few lines of the strophe, this was preceded by, yes, an expressionless laundry list of verbs.)\\""Languageisspoken;otherwiseit'sbroken.\\""(\\""My Lips, Your Face\\"")Do I need to say anything about that? It's the kind of thing college freshmen should be getting in poetry 101 classes as examples of how not to write poetry.Perhaps the most painful thing about reading a Lewin collection is that on very, very rare occasions, he gets it right. Not in the way an Ira Sadoff or a Debra Allbery gets it right, not with a whole, sustained poem that sings its perfection to the heavens. But he'll come up with a line, or even a whole strophe, that Hilda Doolittle, T. S. Eliot, and Ezra Pound look down and smile upon. The image is concrete, there are no extraneous words; there may still be bad line breaks, but it's as good as Lewin gets:\\""First hard frostlike hair sprayarreststhe willow's branchesleaning south and eastin memoryof last night's breeze.\\""(\\""Soon After My Wife's Death\\"")A tad long for haiku, but with the same economy of tone and verbiage. In a hundred-twenty-eight page book, you get more of these minor gems than you do in a smaller book like New Wrinkles, but an increase in pearls guarantees you a greater increase in swine. Ultimately, it's not worth the frustration.The vanity press business has flourished for decades, if not centuries, and one suspect that it's been feeding off the blood of aspiring (and very bad) poets since its very inception. For all I know, poets were the reason for the genesis of the vanity press business. Evanston Publishing (and its more recent and equally loathsome subsidiary, Chicago Spectrum Press) claims it is not a vanity publisher, but someone who takes your money and lets you self-publish using their equipment. (The difference: you, not the press, keep the rights to your work.) It's not exactly a difference of semantics, but the end result is the same.

Guide""","A few years back Martin compiled all the reviews that he'd written (and could still find) and published them under the title \\""The Collector's Guide to Heavy Metal\\"". And while he may have missed a few items he hit all the essentials and more, all the while earning himself a somewhat ambiguous reputation due to his praised inclusions of various grunge and punk albums not to mention his unabashed distaste for entire sub-genres of heavy metal.   After a few \\""fluff\\"" books over the years (\\""The 500 Greatest Heavy Metal Songs\\""? Talk about dragging a magazine article out for far too long) he's finally back to update what may be his only seminal work in the genre. This time \\""The Collector's Guide\\"" is being broken down by decade to allow for the inclusion of more obscure groups Taking full advantage of this, Popoff is now including anything remotely connected with hard rock, let alone heavy metal. I'm not sure this is such a bad idea on the evidence of \\""Coll. Guide: 70's\\"", but then there was a much more blurry line between plain vanilla hard rock and dyed in the wool heavy metal in those halcyon days. To his credit, Popoff does trot out some true obscurities, but as per his previous volume these obscurities lean heavily toward Canadian artists. But, when you have to rely on the efforts of one man to get the job done no one out there has done a finer job for the genre than Martin Popoff (I may have to amend this statement when AMG finally puts out their own metal guide). His musical prejudices notwithstanding, I've always felt that musical criticism should be taken with a grain of salt, and assuming you're one of the wise ones who consults more than one critic before rushing out to buy an album you should be able to enjoy \\""The Collector's Guide...\\"" for exactly what it is: one very informed man's opinion"

The most evident of which was its lack of realism.  Coaches constantly were either swearing at or hitting players. Every collision ended in blood, broken bones, etc. Now  I am aware that coaches establish discipline and that football is a violent  game. But if the game were as this author describes it, who would want to  play it? Unfortunately, this author's description is way off base.  To be  fair, this book is Fiction, so it is the author's right to ""liven  up"" a story in order to make it more entertaining for the reader.  But  his use of real college teams leads one to believe that the story has a  certain element of reality, which this book did not have. I was shocked to  see how many of the other reviewers finished this book and believe they now  have a better insight on Div. 1 football and men's behavior in general.

The Silmarillion is very different than The Hobbit and LOTR. I rated it at 3 stars because I think the book would be of interest mostly to just serious fans of Middle Earth. Just because you enjoyed (or even loved) The Hobbit or LOTR, it is not necessarily true that you will enjoy The Silmarillion. It is a difficult read. There is not much of a connecting narrative. A big reason for these qualms is the simple fact that it was not actually completed by JRR. Rather, his copious notes and writings were tackled by his son Christopher. I think he did a very good job in a difficult situation. However, what results is not a cohesive story. Therefore, I think that unless you are a serious fan of Middle Earth and are interested in delving very deeply into its deep past, The Silmarillion is probably not a great choice for you"

This is a gripping and heartrending work, because Carswell has captured what often can't be captured or communicated later in adult life, the psychosomatic feel of what it's like to live among orphans. This book is tailor-made for a movie.       Especially forceful are scenes of how the orphans' fears were made manifest.        That includes scenes depicting an orphan who, day and night, breaks windows desperately trying to escape, but has no place to go. Scenes of orphans setting off fire alarms in their bedrooms every night, jolting everyone out of sleep miles around. Scenes showing a young, terribly burned, suicidal boy, whose mother tried to kill him in a house fire, who desperately wanted to join his mother in heaven--I know, I couldn't stop crying here--and who could only find value in his own life after the orphanage's administrators helped him enact his own wake.        Especially heartrending are the scenes where, every year at Christmas, Carswell would stare out her backyard window as orphans trekked across the snow in hand-me-down clothes to celebrate in the orphanage's gym with donated toys under a donated tree, alone, none of their parents in sight. Touching too are scenes about orphan Bob Wygant, who overcame painful obstacles to find success and love with his vivacious and kind wife Sally.         All of this is anchored by two powerful moral presences, Carswell's father, John, who selflessly and tirelessly gives of himself daily to the orphans, all the while running his own brood of five towheaded, rambunctious, loving children, including Carswell's bighearted, kind sisters Mandy and Sarah. Helping him along were Carswell's loving, smart AuntMary and fun-loving cousin Laurie.       And who really comes shining through is Carswell's mother, Elaine, a selfless woman who tirelessly gave herself totally in the clarity of love. Elaine is the heart of the book. Carswell deftly shows how her mother's life was simply about one, little three-letter word: Joy.       As Sue's mother's illness advances, as her body is hollowed out by cancer, you'll cry from the pain that echoes throughout these pages, a pain that feels much like a voice echoing in a house without furniture and curtains.         Carswell has accomplished quite a feat. She's carefully woven the stories of orphans in with her own feelings of what it was like for a young girl to absorb their pain and emotion. In so doing, Carswell showed how her genetic makeup of depression and sleep disorder was ignited by her backyard, conditions which were only dealt with as an adult living in New York City.        There's a timeless lesson here for parents, especially to be aware if their child needs help. And there's a lesson here about the value of showing children love every day, not just once a year at Christmas.        In the end, Carswell has written a book that is animated with those first visions of childhood in their original freshness and vigor.        It's hard to find in any work of fiction, much less a memoir, anything that's quite like the pure emotional punch of this book.        It's true, what someone once said, that the effect of intense, heartfelt emotions feels like going down two steps at a time. You feel as if you're drawing on the very source of life itself. That's what this book accomplishes"

Driver ants, slave-making ants, leaf-cutting ants, harvester ants and more are explored with humor, some common sense and lots of wonder.  The only flaw is the author's understanding of evolution.  While he uses Darwin's name a lot his ideas about how ants changed seem to be backwards.  It almost sounds like he thinks ants PLANNED out their changes or changed to suit the changing world.

Although some would think it a blatant attack on the strange phenomenon of religious fundamentalism, Under the Banner of Heaven does not come off preachy or condemning of a religious system the author admits he is outside. All religious attacks from the outside remain just that--outside. I find it refreshing that rather than attempting to produce objective history with no personal bias, Krakauer unapologetically admits his skepticism--and thus his status as an outsider. This admission arms his readers with valuable insight into his inability to comprehend the nature of existential religious experience, what S. Kierkegaard referred to as the teleological suspension of the ethical, or in simple terms, the phenomenon of the Divine giving mandates to individual that run counter to the expected or accepted norms of a particular religious group. The highlights of the book include a very compelling recounting of the life and death of Mormon founder Joseph Smith, as well as fascinating glimpses into the thoughts of self-appointed modern day prophet-turned murderer Ron Lafferty. Krakauer raises some pretty important questions, and as a whole, Under the Banner of Heaven can be characterized as ""not bad coming from an outsider"

In many ways his research is exhaustive. He quotes whole pages of dispatches from the Official Records and has clearly researched the Battle of the Crater and the units involved in the depth one would expect from a Ph.D. and former National Book Award nominee. When he relaxes and allows himself to write, he writes well, and some of the battle scenes are truly excellent. Where this book falters is in its storytelling. It moves slowly. There are too many characters and they become hard to tell apart. The action is broken up by too many retrospectives and dispatches. You really have to have a long attention span to enjoy this book. As far as Slotkin's interpretation of the period, it is very cynical; I put down The Crater thinking that the Union generals really deserved to lose the war for their politicking, stupidity and wanton wasting of their men's lives. Slotkin sees the issue of slavery and black rights as being central to the war, and his book reflects that. One place where he is rather weak is in his portrayal of Southern soldiers: they are not as human and believable as his Northerners. He presents an ongoing clash between officers, even NCOs, and privates which replicates the class conflict which is the underlying theme of the entire book; I'm not sure to what extent this clash really existed, but it is believable within the context of the novel. Overall, this is ponderous and hard to read, but for those who have the patience, it is a very interesting and rewarding effort"

This book fills that bill nicely.Even if you've read about and implemented XP in your shop, there are times you need to review one of the points about how it all works together.  Since the author covers all the main points of XP, you can quickly find the information you need.  You also get a nice cross-reference at the end of each chapter that shows how each point relies on other parts of the methodology.  I find this very useful if you are faced with having to modify XP for your use.  It's recommended that you implement XP in its entirety, as it's meant to be more than the sum of its part.  But if you have to tweak something, you know how it will affect the other areas.I would not recommend this book as your only resource if you were just starting to implement XP.  You really need to read Extreme Programming Explained by Kent Beck.  He's the founder of XP, and that book goes into much more detail as to the whys of the process.  But this book is one that each member of the team should have to keep the concepts fresh.This is a very good book to use as a supplemental reference or reminder guide if you're using the XP methodology.  If you were looking for a concise explanation of XP, this would also work for you.  If you were looking for a more in-depth explanation of the methodology, I would recommend one of the books by Kent Beck"

It depends on when you live.  Mr. Seife makes this point in a very enjoyable manner in the first chapters of this book.  Unfortunately for all of us (at least those of us without advanced degrees in physics, etc.), we live in a time when the explanations are very technical, and involve concepts that seem implausible, if not just plain impossible.They're not, of course - and that's why we need books like this that help us to make sense of these concepts, while not making us feel like morons because we need the help to understand them.  This book does a very good job of doing that.Mr. Seife really loves his subject, and writes about it with great zeal.  The writing, while sometimes (by necessity) very technical, is never dry or dull.  I missed the humor that I found in Stephen Hawking's books of this nature.  By the same token, this book is much better written, and in many ways much more enlightening, than Hawking's \\""The Theory of Everything: The Origin and Fate of the Universe\\"" which often left me confused as to where all of the pieces fit.The key, it seems to me, is that Mr. Seife stays focused on his task at hand: giving the reader the tools necessary to understand current cosmological theories.  He doesn't digress into discussions of theories and areas designed to simply boggle the mind, as Stephen Hawking sometimes does.  Speaking of Stephen Hawking, I am curious how you can write a book of this type, in this time, and not cite Hawking.  Mr. Seife manages to do that.  I wonder if there's something below the surface there.This was a most enjoyable book, and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to increase his or her understanding of our cosmos.

19097680,R2CY97NYZSKGXU,0689825234,737940662,Habibi,Books,3.0,1.0,1.0,Habibi,"Habibi, written by Naomi Shihab Nye, is a book that explains the life of a Palestinian girl and her family who live in St. Louis.  Just after Liyana receives the first kiss of her life she makes a huge life-altering trip back to Israel.  Her father was born there when it was still called Palestine.  She moves there and is introduced to her family's traditions, which are much different than her old ones.  While she's there she meets a Israeli boy named Omer with whom she becomes good friends even though he is Israeli and she is Palestinian.  Liyana's family tries to adapt to the life in Israel and becomes friends with an Israeli. The book has strengths and some weaknesses.  Throughout the book you meet many different characters with different views and opinions on the conflicts in the Middle East.  At first Liyana lives in St. Louis and everything is going well for her, and not seeming to know a lot about the conflict, but then when she has to move she starts to think about her life in Israel.  She meets Omer who is Israeli and has his views of the situation, which gives the reader a feel for what the peaceful Israelis feel about the conflict in Israel.  This makes Liyana develop as a character.  The book starts off with a decent plot and then as they move to Israel, it starts to weaken and, at the end, it collapses.  The kissing in the book added a little confusion to the beginning and then was used too much throughout the story when she relates back to when she was in St. Louis. I would recommend this book to people who enjoy reading about events in history.  People who are in their older teens would not really be able to connect with this.  It gives you a good idea on what is happening in the Middle East, but is really biased toward the Israelis because it talks about how Omer is nice to the Palestinians and would give you the idea that all Israelis are that way.  This book is decent but I would not recommend it to adults and children over the age of 13"

Jake Stone is such a kid as well. He thinks of himself as a born-again loser with no admirable traits. He wishes that he could be someone else, heck, he wishes that he had a DOUBLE who was perfect and would never do the things that the real Jake does. Margery Wake is Jake's only friend. She has a phobia about getting her head wet and has not washed her hair in a long time. When Jake comes to her with a book called ""Change Your Mind and You Can Change Your World"" she laughs at the idea that with the power of your mind, you can change something physical; like washing her hair without water. Until something extraordinary happens. Nathan has arrived in town and he looks and sounds but doesn't act like Jake! He has come to stay with the Stone family and help in anyway he can. Nathan does everything the right way the first time and though that is a great thing at first...people start to forget Jake ever existed! In-fact they think Nathan IS Jake. Only Margery can help save Jake against fading away into nothing and to help him recognize his self worth before it is too late. I truly enjoyed this book. My only wish for this book was that Jake had truly realized the worth of himself and had been able to reflect and help the reader see that there are important things that the reader must see in themselves to recognize their worth as well"

Both character development and plot seemed overly contrived and personally midway through the novel I really didn't care what happened.  The upcoming marriage of Jamie and Max was a water-downed affair and didn't really add any interest to the storyline.  The mystery lacked suspense and some of the new characters were dull.  Give me Lulu or Grandma Mazur anytime!  I'd rather wait for the next Plum novel than a new book in this series

This story tales places between ESB and ROTJ.  I always felt it was one of the more important stories of the Expanded Universe given that Xizor became an action figure as did Dash Render and his ship (Outrider).  The whole gang is in this one even Han, though is encased in carbonite.  We get Vader, the emperor, Fett, Guri, Boosk, 4-Lom, Jabba, Zuckuss and Wedge along with the regular gang of heroes.  Apparently Dark horse did have available any pictures of Lando or Leia because the artists did a lousy job of drawing them.  Most of the time Luke was OK, but sometimes he looked like Jessica Lynch.  They did do a great job drawing Fett, Vader and dash however.Everyone is searching for Han, but he has not be taken directly to Jabba.  Xizor has risen to lead Black Sun which has thrived since Darth Maul wiped out the old leadership.  His newest ambition is to replace Vader as #2 in the empire.  Xizor orders Luke killed knowing that Vader wants him alive.  Then Xizor captured Leia. This is one of my favorite of all the EU stories.  Steve Perry has created a new and exciting Journey.  The novel is 4 stars and the comic is 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4.  Considering that Dark horse released this in 1997 before some of their awesome new production techniques, this is a very well done comic.  The abridged audio cassette is good quality, but at on 2  hours to much is cut"

It is a novel that mixes witchcraft and zombies, horror and romance without shame. The first half of the book is amazing and intriguing. Two stories are being told; the first takes place in the modern period, where an investigator is given a case that includes strange deaths and disappearence and dead bodies that keep on walking. The second story takes place in the 1800s as a witch community is founded and, of course, things start going wrong. Slowly, the two stories interconnect and become one.I loved the first part of the book. I just couldn't put it down. The only problem is that there might have been too many characters, but that was just a minor problem. You start caring for Miles, the main character, early on in the story. His character is very well define, much more than your average horror book. Unfortunately, the book lost me in its last 50 pages, as it becomes way over-the-top and too unbelievable. But then again, that's a problem with most Bentley Little books. He puts way too much at the end. So instead of being a good, thrilling finale, you get all the blood and guts that can fit within 50 pages. After a while, too much is too much.But overall, The Walking is a great beach book that is easy to read. There are many very frightening moments in the book and the story is always intriguing. So overall, a good effort which is somewhat undermined by its ending"

AMG's additional material (detailed histories, music maps of significant players, bios including birth and death dates, book & video reviews, essays) makes it the one I'd choose if I had to choose between them, but I'd hate to have to. What the Penguin Guide has that AMG doesn't: more in-depth, better-written reviews of specific CDs (although AMG has more listings, e.g., AMG = 89 listings for John Coltrane, Penguin = 66); more listings of European artists. For example, just starting with the \\""A's\\"", Penguin begins with AALY Trio (a Swedish trio), then lists Eivind Aarset (a Norwegian guitarist and computerist), then Abash (another Swedish trio), and finally gets to Greg Abate, who is the first listing in AMG.

I like not knowing who's on what side.  What fun is it if you can trust all the characters?  But I was still disappointed by the characters, especially the females.  I really can't stand Sansa, and I wish we could see more from Arya, but both of them and Catelyn seem to lack...something...like they're a bit too stereotypical.  Maybe there's more development in the next books.  I loved the descriptions, the intrigue, the ominous mystery.  Slow in the beginning, the plot steadily builds.It took a few chapters to adjust to the sudden point of view changes, but different doesn't mean bad.  If you're willing to get lost in a totally believable world, and are stubborn enough to get to where the exposition stops and the rising action starts the ball rolling, you're in for quite a ride.  I'm going to read the second book and hope that some characters come to their senses and maybe some more make me care about them more.  But I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a good fantasy, and I don't recommend lightly.  Also, if you like heavy plot and engrossing characters, try Michelle West's Sun Sword series or Hunter's Oath books...not perfect, but enjoyable if you can get through the beginnings.  The hardest part always is the beginning"

If you choose the later, Kushell's The Young Entrepreneur's Edge can help you along that path.The book is basically a \\""how to\\"" for starting a business.  It presents and answers all of the questions that you might really need to know the answer to, but felt too stupid to ask.  It also touches on many things that a first-time entrepreneur may be unaware of or forget (like IRS withholding, etc.).  The book is primarily for someone planning to start a business for the first time and will offer little advice to the seasoned business-owner.  Of value, though, especially to younger readers (of all levels of business experience) are the sections on dealing with perception of youth in a business context which may get a more thorough treatment here than in any other manuscript.  Entrepreneurs of all ages and experience-levels will also enjoy the start-up-stories that pepper the book.  The books one real lack, however, may be in the accuracy department.  For example, Kushell gets the IRS 1099 and W2 form confused, which may seem like a simple mistake but could inadvertently subject a business to a variety of liability (W2 employees are the traditional salaried/wage employees where the 1099 form is used for reporting income for independent contractors - [website] has extensive information on tax forms).  The book, thus, is a good overview and may alert you to things that need to be looked into further, but additional research will be required to verify and understand each topic.Overall, the book is a must-read for anyone under 30 starting a \\""real\\"" business for the first time.  For others, it may serve as a refresher or provide an amusing read, but will be of limited usefulness"

In this moving tale published in 1983, the story reads as a skillful blending of a long parable and historical Bible narrative.  Think this might sound boring?  Not in the least.  Card draws you into the story and provokes you to think.  This is one of his many gifts.  There is hidden meaning throughout this book.  You'll see this in both the obvious and subtle passages of the story.  And as you reflect on what he has to say, you'll also find yourself relating to his characters.  You'll care for them.  And as they experience trials, hardships, pain, sacrifice, and joy, you'll experience it along with them.  In Hart's Hope, Card uses one of his typical character techniques: A young child.  In this case, two young children.  Though their birth's are separated in time by many years, their paths are destined to cross.  And though both have been inflicted with childhood scars of unjust pain and suffering, their ultimate divergent responses are as opposite as night and day.  Where the one chooses to permanently hate and seek retribution, the other seeks to heal.  And in doing so, ascends to those heights attainable only through self-sacrificing love.  My only disappointment with this book was that it had to end.  Like all of Card's stories, you don't want the story to finish, but to just keep going on"

As with all of Morrison's novels, this one deals with basic  human needs, virtues and failings. Race and sex are only some of the  determining factors. The driving force is fear. Fear of contamination from  outside, fear of rejection, fear of ones own weakness, fear of women's  power, fear of fear.

A gloom that has shadowed the island turns violent one day changing ages-long nourished perspectives of the life. It turns in a macabre tragedy...telling us a brutal truth we always love to neglect.

And when it rains, it pours.  Never mind the adage about things happening in three's--you can double that and just keep going with all the stuff happening to Dr. Gregory.  The best part was that although most things worked out in the end, it wasn't your typical happy ending with everything tied up in a neat package.

The kid went to college for five years and still didn't graduate, and he did an internship after four years at Syracuse. Grisham said that his grades were on a steady decline as he progressed through college. So, for me, this was like reading the story of my life. I've been going to college for journalism for over three years and my grades have been on a steady decline.

The basic ingredients of the plot are:  a \\""mad as hell, I'm not going to take it anymore\\"" protagonist named Scott Stahl, an apocalyptic comet heading toward the earth, the internet as political leveler, and spirituality grounded in direct experience of the divine.  Although the plot is an improbable mix of ingredients, it works well and the message is contemporary and necessary:  we - each individual - must choose in our hearts the kind of world we want, and we must act on our choosing with conviction - now.

The first section is excellent for its time (1900s), even if he dismisses the somewhat more established Cumont with one  sentence! But this introductory section does contain some worthwhile  historical material, and sheds some useful light particularly on the  onomatapeic sections of the text.The second section is the text itself  which he has based on Dieterich's German version. It is conveniently  sectioned, and euphonically translated.The third section is the weakest  in my opinion, for it offers a gnostic interpretation of the text (which,  we must agree with Meyer, is not wholly Mithraic and indeed Mead himself  admits has much Egyptian additional material). Mead here seems awkwardly  balanced between being a Mithraist and being a gnostic, arguing that the  text itself was for performance by an individual, whereas evidence of  course tells us that Mithraism was practiced as a group activity. But then  Mead seems to be suggest using the text not as a Mithraic exercise at all  but as a general initiation into a higher realm of gnosis.He uses Mithra  on occasion and Mithras on others"

The situations depicted are everyday situations:  Introducing the family members, inside the house, in the street, purchasing bus & theater tickets, seeking employment, asking directions.  Each cartoon has a phrase containing the dialog and a cloud within the cartoon panel showing what the characters are talking about.  I spoke very little Hebrew when I used this method and it gave me a solid background in conversational Hebrew so that when I went to Israel, I became fluent in a very short time.  Each lesson is divided into two parts.  The first part introduces new words and the second part uses these words in a different way.  I would recommend using this book with an instructor who is conversant in Hebrew.  After each lesson, the instructor should converse with the student in Hebrew using the words from the lesson.  It is most natural to learn how to speak a language before learning how to read and write it.  This book reinforces the words and sentence structure   by associating the cartoons with the phrases introduced in the lesson"

Author Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini has done a masterful job of arraying some of the most serious and most commonplace errors of judgment, estimation and deduction. The style is mostly straightforward, if academic, and makes the meat of the book's message accessible to the general reader. One quibble is that the author's explanation of certain probability calculations (especially Bayes' theorem) leaves them less clear than they could be. That aside, we give this book the highest recommendation, especially for those who like to consider how people understand their world. If you are devoted to clear thinking, you could practically use it to conduct a daily scrutiny of your mental processes - an examination of cognition similar to the monastic examination of conscience - to identify and correct any inclinations to serious cognitive sin"

I liked this story, but I thought it should have been longer. It seemed a little rushed and underdeveloped, like it was trying to cover too many peoples' lives and not spending sufficient time with any one person to make you care very much for them. Other than Pauli Winter (the younger of the two main characters in the story, the other being his older brother), Deighton doesn't really develop the other characters very much. The story seemed to revolve mostly around Pauli's life and the others were sort of just supplementing him.  I thought the idea that Pauli's mom had fallen for the British spy \\""Boy\\"" Piper was a good idea, but the way the \\""romance\\"" was described seemed more like Deighton tells the reader that they fell in love in about one paragraph rather than create a convincing scenario to make the average reader believe it.  I honestly wouldn't have minded if this book was twice as long, because Deighton has a rich writing style that I very much enjoy, and there were hints of it in this book but it should have been developed more. As it is, a worthy effort, but not a classic like Bomber or The Ipcress File (the only spy book I've read from Deighton"

Nicholas Fashon, around which the plot revolves, has inherited the rights to his grandfather's all-purpose kitchen gadget the Handy Mate (one of many doohickey inventions the old man fiddled around with). Getting the Handy Mate manufactured and marketed is Fashon's goal to make it big, but there are many roadblocks in his way, including a violent loanshark, a sexy female chef, and the police who suspect Fashon of torching his apparel store for insurance money. The book's humor is derived from twists in the plot and nonsensical situations between Fashon and a number of secondary characters, in a similar vein to earlier Hautman books.

After reading many channeled books about ET's and their missions on earth, I wondered if I had become a bit jaded about them.  However, Jane Egan fascinates the reader with her vivid accounts describing her astral visits to the Mothership and explains what the Pleiadean mission is about.  It's a highly entertaining book, full of specific examples of how she becomes involved in helping planet Earth and all it's inhabitants while learning even more about mankind's history and evolution. I was especially lucky to have met the author and heard first hand accounts of her nightly visits with her Pleiadean friends.   So often we are bombarded with information about the ""Greys"" or Zeta Reticuli abducting people for experimentation.  It often leaves us wondering if there are any ""good"" aliens and if there are, what can they do to help us.  Jane describes in great detail what the Pleiadeans are doing to help humanity right now and how each of us can work with them to help further our transition into the 4th dimension.  In the book, she does such a great job of describing the Pleiadeans she met that I feel as though I somehow know them also.  I applaud her courage to share this information with all of us and to help us understand that many Star People from other worlds are dedicating their time and efforts to the spiritual evolution of Earth's inhabitants.  Great job Jane and to all your Pleiadean friends I say Thank You!"

What I liked the most about the book is that it is very well documented and facts are well supported. I liked also the structure and how the author chose what issues to write about and dedicate special attention. One thing to keep in mind is that the author was friends of Romulo, so I am wondering if this biased a little the approach of some of his conclusions.

It also somehow manages to evade a large amount of readers, mainly because of 2 misconceptions.The first, and most common, is that this is a children's book.  Some schools have even picked up on this, choosing it for 7th or 8th grade classrooms.  Many people choose not to read it because of this, without realizing that it was never meant to be a children's book.  Yes, the main character is a child, but the characters and subject matter are much more suitable for an adult novel, and the writing style is clearly more adult oriented, without the simple plotlines most carry.  The existential undertones also bring this out of the realm of children's books.  Unfortunately, many people don't realize and just say \\""Eh, it's a kids book, why bother?\\""  The second main reason people don't read this book is because \\""It's Sci-Fi, and I don't like Sci-Fi.\\""  What they don't realize is, yes, it's sci-fi, but it's more than that.  A very little bit of science fiction is actually in this book.  It is, for the most part, an examination of childhood innocence, the true meanings of right and wrong, and the mental struggles of pressure.  This book is much more psychological than Science Fiction, as the emphasis is constantly put on the mental state of Ender Wiggin, other than alien killing and the usual Science Fiction fare.  In all honestly, this book would be just as effective if it weren't science fiction at all.  The idea of simulated wars and children being trained as soldiers could be set in modern times or the past just as well.  I would challenge anyone who doesn't like Science Fiction to read this and not like it.Once you get past those two misconceptions, you get to see what a wonderful book Ender's Game really is.  The concept is intriguing, the characters, especially the main character, are superbly developed.  The ideas about war, peace, existance and willpower will certainly get you thinking, and the ending will leave you wanting more.  Thankfully, there are plenty of sequels.One last note, if you read this book, I would highly reccomend you read Ender's Shadow as well.  It gives valuable background information and character development which can make the original all the more enjoyable"

This was with the ironic view of the prevention of Western Imperialism stretching to their shores, and the adapting and embracing of many inherent values to strengthen their own empire. So, yes, it's specialist in this sense, but the way the introduction and the contents have been written and explained (with perhaps traditional Japanese efficiency), makes it a very interesting and very informative read for all who can show at least a little concentration of something 'a little on the heavy side'.As a bonus, because of the data-intensive contents, interesting snippets such as the different reigns and even much of the Japanese Calendar is here. Ultimately, it may not be for you, but you will be impressed by an absolutely staggering start, devoid of over-heavy grammar which accompanies many similar tomes. Very, very well done, Ian Ruxton"

Bush, it had become clear to the nation that the U.S.-led war on terror would be expanding its measures to encompass the very heart of the middle east: the fertile crecent, Iraq. As a political science-broadcast journalism double major I found it most pertinent to make my opinion an educated one in regards to where I stand in the war on terror--and more specifically with the war on Iraq.      Con Coughlin's book was a milestone in my understanding of the life of Saddam Hussein (from his tragic childhood onward), the premises of the Gulf War, and the underlying facts of what seemed to me to be 'Gulf Wars: Episode II,' as the popular parody poster reads. It was smart, fast-paced, and not insulting to my intelligence like many historic journals that are not written for accomplished historians tend to be.     I am proud to say that after reading that book, written by an English Journalist, I know exactly where I stand in the war on terror and can honestly vouch that my vote will not be with Kerry. Historically, The Liberal America has been weak on National Security. Alger Hiss was made Secretary of State by Frank Roosevelt well after the FBI had produced documents declaring him a Soviet Spy. After Russian codes were effectively discovered and de-coded, the myth became fact and Hiss was arrested. Shortly after his release he received a standing ovation at Stanford University. Liberals also condemned Reagan for winning the cold war.        After reading 'Saddam: King of Terror,' I will not allow my country to be given to a group of people whom to this day still put the War on Terror in quotation marks. Finally, we have a president willing to put horrible, brutal, monsters to abrupt meetings with justice and will not let a coalition of interest groups interfere with the interests of the nation.        My only criticism of the book is the lack of chronological continuity. The text tends to jump from time to time here in there with confuses the flow of reading. On top of that, it throws a lot of Iraqi groups, organizations, and Arab names at you and expects you to remember them throughout the course of the book. My suggestion: take brief notes.       Interesting fact:  Next to her husband, Eleonore Roosevelt's favorite man in the world was none other than Joseph Stalin, a man guilty of killing over 20,000,000 Georgians during his reign as Russian Premier"

Alas, most of this information is lost.Nonetheless, there were a few amazing tidbits about the participants in this great project. My favorite is about John Layfield, a writer who actually journeyed to the Caribbean and then contributed to the work on Genesis in this bible.

Especially valuable is the worksheet on federal financial aid which gives one the ability to see how changes in one's finances can change computed financial need.  Most financial aid websites just give you a grand total without explaining how the numbers were calculated.

38942748,R1ZJ00OFLQWTM7,0684857278,478262653,Mall: A Novel,Books,4.0,2.0,2.0,Pleasantly mauled by &quot;The Mall&quot;,"Generally, I dislike shopping malls; their only redeeming feature  is if they happen to have a bookstore. A book titled MALL is not likely to be one I'd grab off the shelf. In this case, however, the title \\""MALL\\"" on the cover is darkly encircled by the barrel of a gun, an apt image for what follows. Linked by the terroristic revengeful rampage of a drug-hyped low-life, the lives of half-a-dozen characters are examined in chapters which shuffle the events through their various perspectives. Bogosian's thematic concerns and structure here remind me somewhat of Stephen Wright's GOING NATIVE, though with more obviously linked plot threads and far less verbal denseness than the latter. Though GOING NATIVE may rate higher for literary sophistication, MALL is not without that and is definitely more the \\""page-turner.\\"" Between the two novels, the difference is, appropriately, that of shopping immersed downtown in a big city, say Chicago or Hong Kong (GOING NATIVE), and excursion shopping in a suburban mall (MALL). Not to say that Bogosian is sympathetic to the mall milieu; although it's not always easy to tell where his sympathies lie, one suspects he is not entirely critical of one of the character's (Jeff's) view of the mall as nightmare-consumerism rubber stamped across the American dream. The fact that the novel's amorally amuck perp is named \\""Mal,\\"" only an `l' away from his eventual target, is both a hint on the author's sympathies and an example of his occasional heavy handedness in stylistic device.A blurb on the back of my paperback copy speaks of \\""the hope (Bogosian) manages to elicit from the carnage.\\"" If this novel promises any hope, it's a far cry from the way that malls promise bargains but with much of the same result. The most admirable character, Michael, an immigrant and mall employee who goes on a self-appointed chase of the madman (separate from the inept and sometimes laughable efforts of the local law), does have a redeeming vision in the aftermathof his demise, but under local circumstances of stupidity and disregard that belie any relevance it might  have to the bigger picture. If the measure of redemption is to be found in the comfort of death-throe visions, Mal's end is no less happy than Michael's.In some ways, the most disturbing character in the book, and the one who most embodies the consumerist values of malls, is Donna, an uncircumspect, faithless housewife who is utterly absorbed in the consumption of gratuitous food, sex, alcohol, and general self-stroking. Never quite, but always almost, at the center of the horrendous events around her, Donna goes happily on her way eating, drinking and screwing to great excess, generally unaffected by crisis or moral impulse of any kind. If there is any hint that this self-indulgence is anything less than self-satisfying and justified, it would be easy to miss. Donna's credo might be, in a world gone grotesquely awry, don't fight it: Consume and be consumed by it. It works here. At least for her. Though the violence makes compelling reading, the book may have more to do with addiction than bloodshed. If amorality can have extremes, Donna and Mal must be close to the opposite ends, but both share in common their addictive natures. Neither character, however, leaves one thinking that it's not the addiction, per-se, that's good or bad, but what you do with it. The character whose addiction is not simply amoral, for better or worse, probably because he on some level tries to come to terms with it, is Danny, a businessman whose sexually unsatisfying marriage has contributed to his soft-porn obsession with models of ladies underwear, the J.C. Penny's Catalogue variety. To the extent that he is an unwitting victim of circumstance in the pathetically funny denouement of his personality quirk, Danny's punishment is the one that seems most out of proportion to his crime. He might also be the novel's closest pretension to having a tragic hero. In a world where porn and perversion, as well as sex-for-sale and sell-by-sex, are rampant , Danny's view of his own prurient predilections, self-described and treated by others as perversion, seems naively harsh. If his \\""nasty\\"" habit  is some kind of disease, little doubt is left that it is to some extent a socially transmitted one, as is Danny's own out-of-proportion self-castigation (almost castration). Perhaps Danny will be transformed by his ordeal into a better person; if so, the price of redemption is high. More likely, the future the novel promises him is further self-deflation in a material world, just as it promises Donna continued empty inflation.Did I like this book? Yes, and this worries me. I could get addicted to this kind of reading. I'm not sure if it's a step up from John Grisham, whose novels I also enjoy but not without a feeling of some guilt that may not be unlike Danny's in MALL (though not to the same degree). I suspect that MALL may be of more lasting literary value than, say, THE STREET LAWYER (with which it shares some thematic concerns). Why?

MacMillan's comprehensive model breaks down the somewhat mysterious business of effective teamwork and gives an overarching framework that gets to the heart of high performance.  Six components (Purpose, Roles, Leadership, Processes, Relationships, and Communication) form a wheel that turns throughout the book.  Each section of the wheel is explained in detail, with plentiful anecdotes and visual aids.  The author also includes sections on team principles, possible pitfalls, and the process of building a high-performance team, among others.  At the end of each chapter the author addresses `the bottom line' and includes a message to team leaders, making the principles of the book practical and doable.  A helpful team assessment instrument is included in an appendix.  Teams have become an integral component of successful organizations, and in this book MacMillan makes high performance teamwork accessible to anyone interested in learning.  Packed with wisdom and insight, it's a must-read for anyone working with others to achieve extraordinary results"

The endorsement as a selection by Oprah's Book Club actually put me off a little when I saw it on the cover, since it was a  little hard for me to imagine the Oprah watchers of America reading  anything that wasn't trite, cliched, and formulaic.  But this book is  good. In a way, it's too good.  What I mean by that is that this is the  kind of book which has the potential to break the frozen ice of the soul  and stir compassion, a dangerously limiting quality if you're in the front  seat with the rest of America on its frantic ride to riches at any cost and  consumption as being.Which is why I think a number of people are annoyed  by the book, characterizing it as depressing. It's not a depressing book,  but it's a real book -- maybe a little too real for those who might prefer  to believe that there is no real suffering in the world, or that it all  reduces finally to indulging in ""victim mentality.""Reading  those sorts of reviews here says as much about the zeitgeist of our times  as it does about the book.

The wants and fears are the same, the clothes are the same, and most definitely the music is the same.If Benjamin Kritzer was obsessed with songs, movies, and records in the first two volumes of this trilogy (Benjamin Kritzer and Kritzerland), in Kritzer Time he makes the short leap to passion for them.  And he makes two amazing a life-changing discoveries about himself:  he can CREATE music, and he can hold an audience in the palm of his hand.In short, as so many of us long to do, Benjamin Kritzer discovers a wonderful and joyful world outside his own.  But is it really outside?  Perhaps the world he has grown up in is the alien one (he always suspected it was so) and the world he is about to step into is the one he belonged in all the time.Readers of the first two books will be joyful at the return of familiar characters and relish the introductions to new ones.Life is wonderful and tragic, and a reader knows his heart has been touched when he immediately understands the feelings the author is expressing.  With moments of high hilarity and other moments of sorrow and longing, Kritzer Time mines that richest of all fields, an adolescence, and comes up with such gold and treasures that it should be kept in a safe place"

It also recounts his complicated and close relationship with his brother and collaborator Diego. It was truly illuminating about the life of such an incredible artist.However, the writing style is pretentious and sometimes so ""writerly"" as to be opaque.

It takes the reader further than standard identification guides are designed to do - the typical habitat of each bird is described, as well as the bird's relationship with its environment and man, followed by a physical description of both sexes and, in many cases, of juveniles in both spring and autumn plumage. The reader will find not only the important identification pointers, but also where to look for specific birds, their nesting and mating habits, and migration ranges. Each notation contains the bird's common and technical name and useful hints about spotting it.  Enhancing the written information are the beautiful and accurate drawings of Terence Shortt, one of this continent's most skilled bird illustrators. Shortt not only renders the birds with unflagging accuracy, but puts them in their appropriate natural context. On the cover is the Great Horned Owl, and on the back is the Peregrine Falcon, reproduced from a drawing made at Fort Ross, Somerset Island, Northwest Territories on September 1, 1938.  ABOUT THE AUTHOR  John P. S. Mackenzie came to bird watching on a hunting trip when his companion corrected his misidentification of a dowitcher. From that moment he was transfixed, and in the last 20 years has traveled thousands of miles in various parts of the world collecting bird sightings. His intense interest led him to study the existing bird literature and this book is a result of his belief that what was needed was a volume offering more information than the standard field guides, but not as unwieldy as the academic texts. His description of the birds is illuminated by personal observations gleaned over the years and his practical experience in the field. The dry words of his official biography fail to do justice to John P. S. Mackenzie, a man who has achieved notable success in the worlds of finance, public service, and conservation. He is chairman of the Nature Conservancy of Canada, a director of Canada's National Ballet School and the Shaw Festival at Niagara-on-the-Lake, and a former director of many other major cultural institutions. Collaborating with him not only in his field work but in the preparation of this book is his wife, Lois Parkhill, a nature writer and bird watcher.   ABOUT THE ARTIST  Terence Shortt is one of North America's most distinguished bird illustrators. He has been with the Royal Ontario Museum for 46 years, first in the department of ornithology, then as head of the life sciences art and display department. In these capacities he has traveled extensively throughout North America and other parts of the world to collect specimens and to paint birds. The Winnipeg-born and trained artist has illustrated more than 20 books on birds and counts among his fans Roger Tory Peterson, the dean of American bird watchers. Terence Shortt is an elective life member of the American Ornithologists' Union and a fellow of the Explorers' Club"

It's obvious that for the anonymous  critics it's so much easier to be clever than to actually say something or  even attempt to. In other words it's easier to write an anonymous personal  attack, laid thick with cynicism, nihilism, jealousy, hostility and  aggression than it is to attempt an actual meaningful work of art.

Coming in a close second was the very detailed description of the land and the magic and the customs.  I feel that I could move there and know what people were talking about!

I didnt really like thepoems that were not written with a narrative style.  Many ofthem seemed too ambiguous and didnt really keep myattention as well as I thought they should have.  I like poems that are morestraight forward and simple, with a complex meaning deeperinside (much like a lot of William Blakes work).  This isnot Waters style and that is probably why I have theseproblems with his book.   Note that I did say that I have mixed reviews for thebook.  There were a lot of things that Waters did do that Ireally liked.  I enjoyed some of his poems simply because ofthe topics.  Most of the poetry in the poem dealt with sexin one way or another.  His poetry has a very smooth flowand often times a sexual connotation was thrown in to breakup the reading and re-capture the readers attention (atleast thats what it did for me).  I liked the sexual natureof the poems and how he used this topic to cover such topicsas love lost, a teenager being horny, bathing or even ametaphor for nature.  In one of my favorite pieces, Voyeur,Waters makes reference to leaving the blind open whilehaving sex just to add a little thrill to the process.  ...their lovemaking self-conscious, a rehearsedchoreography of mouths and genitalsfor the imaginary voyeur who quickened their pleasure withhis presence.  He makes the point that just the idea that someone could bewatching is enough to cause arousal. The author also used the idea of God a lot in the book,especially at the end.  This could of been a resolution ofsome sort, but Im not sure.  God is seen as an everydayperson just doing his job in poems like Driftwood.  JesusChrist is even compared to James Brown in Christ at theApollo:1962.  I like these metaphors because I think thatit keeps the reader into the poem and always looking for thenext clever thought by the poet.  These, along with theintense imagery of body parts in a lot of his poems are thepositives I found in Waters book.  However, in a lot of thepoems I felt like the flow became so steady the reader couldbecome lost in the words that didnt have a lot ofdirection.  That is why I enjoyed the sexual breaks so much.

While ""Tell Me Lies"" has a lot of Crusie's trademark quick wit, super-sharp dialogue, and appealing characters, it seemed often frustrating and jumbled. I think Crusie maybe tackles too many serious themes, and though with each she is beautifully perceptive & articulate, I found myself getting irritated by the constant distraction away from Maddie's central problem.  For instance, Crusie's narrative would touch on something that really built tension and curiosity, and then suddenly there would be long passages dedicated to Maddie's daughter Em and all her precociousness, Em and her friend Mel in their treehouse, etc. I couldn't help but feel that Em's place in the story detracted from the fluidity of the plot.  Another example - while Crusie successfully captured how stifling the gossipy small town of Frog Pointe could be, at the same time, it got to the point where I just wanted to tear my hair out in frustration that everyone was seriously THAT obsessed with ""what will people say"" that they seemed to base every single action on what the neighbors would think - including Maddie at many critical points in the novel.  Very irritating, at least to me. The upside of the book was the beauty of the writing itself, the sweetness of C.L., and most importantly, the development of Maddie's self-identity.

""Over the Blue Mountain is the tale of two boys in 19th Century  Pennsylvania Dutch country who try to find the truth behind an old folk  tale.  Richter employs his usual mastery of language to give this tale an  authentic ring.  As usual, Richter describes in detail the daily life in a  small town during this time period.  Although it's ostensibly a children's  story, Richter almost seems to be writing at his usual level, which might  make the language and plotting a little hard for the very young children to  understand.  For older children, this story will serve as a testament to a  vanished American way of life and might stimulate some interesting  questions"

Many of us know about numerous anime, or ""Japanimation"" series like Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball Z, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and others like that. But few people know much about the roots of anime, MANGA. This book is a fantastic source on modern manga in Japan. It goes over conventions, the doujinshi scene, the current state of manga, the more popular manga magazines in Japan, popular artists and their work (featuring tons of B&W illustrations), and a section devoted to Osamu Tezuka (the Manga no Kamisama, or God of Manga). Each section is well written and interesting to read. The different artists work range from romance stories to action stories to the fascinatingly grotesque works of Suehiro Maruo. This book reaffirmed my love for manga, and I'm now snapping up all the collections translated into English that I can find. The only reason it failed to get five stars is because while it is an awesome book, it's predecessor, ""Manga! Manga!"" is even better!"

Kingsolver has outdone herself.  It just bowled me over.  This is an incredible story that haunts you long after the last page is read.  It's like watching a  car crash in slow motion.  Disaster looms ahead plain to see, getting  closer and closer and finally it hits with awesome power.  And then hits  again.  Chaos and disaster are seldom written with such compassion - or  wit.  I laughed in even some of the most horrible moments.  As always with  Kingsolver's stories, the human spirit triumphs.This book starts slow.   Think malaria, think the haze of jungle heat.  Think of ghosts.  In this  modern day and age we are accustomed to our entertainment starting off with  big explosions and fighting.  Not here.  Be still and let the jungle creep  in on you with vines and fungus.  Let this story invade you.  This book  is like two books really.  Some say this is bad writing.  In truth, it is  two books.  And that's how it has to be.  There is a before and there is an  after.  I found it very effective storytelling.  The shockwaves of the  central tragedy continue to ripple through the characters' lives as they go  their separate ways.  The Poisonwood Bible, like the best books, is  about everything.  And Kingsolver isn't afraid to challenge her readers.  How do we respond to tragedy?  Who do we become in a seemingly injust  world.  Fighters?  Scientists?  Ghosts? How do we make sense of the world  and live as we should?  Kingsolver delights in challenging our  perspectives.  In this tale even snakes have their place in the universe.   Provocative, stunningly beautiful, and a great story.  Enjoy!"

It looks even more likely that the killer is the man that Caroline Mabry confronted but had to let get away during a drug bust gone bad.Caroline Mabry and Alan Dupree are the two main protagonists and are both detectives with the Spokane Police Department. They share a past that is slowly revealed to us as they become more involved with the case, and this begins to affect the way they carry out their investigations.This is Walter's debut novel and is a psychological thriller that starts out very well with an action packed and dramatic opening, snappy dialogue carrying plenty of humorous exchanges. But then the story gradually gets bogged down in the middle as the main characters all become very introspective. I had the feeling that we were in suspended animation for a while, waiting for someone to yell \\""action\\"". However the pace does pick up again as things fall into place and set the scene for a thrilling and somewhat surprising ending.A highlight of the book for me comes from the description of the two profilers whose dislike for each other provides plenty of funny scenes. Their egos and obvious distraction from the case while compiling data for their respective next books add a touch of comic farce to the story.I found this an entertaining book that toyed with the emotions, dark enough to provide a substantial, thought-provoking thriller, yet light enough to provide plenty of amusing moments"

45581174,R1QF1UQGZI8KDC,0262041898,904694437,American Foundations: An Investigative History,Books,5.0,1.0,2.0,Foundations in Cross Examination,"There are over 50,000 foundations in the U.S. today.  With $448 billion in assets (1999), foundations are an unbelievably huge philanthropic industry compared to almost 40 years ago, when the federal government launched its War on Poverty.  Foundations' assets then were well under $30 billion.  Mark Dowie, author of American Foundations:  An Investigative History (MIT Press, 2001), does not blanche in analyzing this industry, despite its diversity and differences in grant making and style of operating. Dowie sets an ambitious agenda.  He reviews foundation funding of education, science, health, environment, food, energy, art, civil society, democracy and imagination!  He is an accomplished writer with16 journalist awards and five books to his credit.  Perhaps consumer activist and Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader suggests best why this book should be read by those involved with the foundation world either as a staff member, trustee, grantseeker or academician.  Dowie, says Nader, ""is a scholar and a muckraker,"" who analyzes ""foundations' past achievements and failures and then critically [takes] the institutions to task for directing their grants so often away from ?root causes.' Dowie shakes up the complacency, myopia, and insulation of [the] giant foundations by naming names and places."" Dowie clearly raises the most important questions about foundations' performance, and offers thoughtful, usually balanced answers that certainly pull no punches.  As the longtime director of a national watchdog nonprofit organization charged with monitoring and redirecting foundations' grantmaking toward the disadvantaged and disenfranchised in the USA, I believe this study is both highly readable and extremely informative.  Education receives the largest share of foundation grants. Dowie observes that ""Foundation trustees...seem to favor the spawning of an elite intellectual force over the principle of equal educationalopportunity...The great preponderance of educational grants...have found their way to institutions of higher education where scientists and other experts are educated.""  Recently, however, more foundation money has been poured into reform of primary and secondary education, especially inner city schools.  This money was stimulated by Walter Annenberg's $500 million challenge grant in 1993.  Dowie applauds this trend.  Nevertheless, he raises the question: Can such money ever change the entrenched public education monopoly to enable it to do significantly better educating poor and poorly prepared students?  Maybe the foundations should ""also be funding community organizations that demand more of public schools..."" ""American foundations' second largest area of grantmaking is health.""  Dowie concludes that ""foundations' enthusiasm for high-tech diagnostic systems, pharmacology, and the disease model of medicine has not only inhibited the development of preventative and holistic approaches but has also retarded public health and fostered the evolution of an essentially unjust health care system...Until quite recently the public health effects of environmental pollution have been virtually ignored by the large foundations.""More generally, beyond specific subject areas, Dowie identifies proactive philanthropy for criticism:  ""...when proactive philanthropy is pursued without the participation of the people most affected by it"" serious problems result.The 50-year Green Revolution is often touted as one of the foundation world's greatest achievements.  Dowie acknowledges its success in significantly raising food production per acre in the developing world.  But he goes on to challenge its social, economic and environmental consequences for the peasant-farmers and the urban poor.  Unfettered scientific experimentalism in increasing crop yields, supported by the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations, with little heedto culture, economics and sustainability, meant the rich got richer and the poor poorer, with 800 million people still hungry in the world.The Energy Foundation was created in 1991 by the Pew Charitable Trusts, MacArthur and the Rockefeller Foundations ""to assist the nation's transition to a sustainable energy future by promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy.""  This was a major proactive foundation initiative to do what the environmental movement was not perceived to be doing.  Dowie records the positive accomplishments of the Energy Foundation, but worries that ""concentrating so much leverage in one funding body could create serious power problems, as well as an orthodoxy, that, if misguided, would be difficult to challenge.""  And, in the end, he identifies how the Energy Foundation gave its largest grants to environmental legal organizations which were ""agents of capitulation...deferring to free market arguments,"" while ""throwing mere crumbs to energy visionaries, renewable activists, and consumer advocates.""Dowie's investigation into American foundations is not all negative.  The author identifies several individual philanthropists as possible  harbingers of ""a new and imaginative era of philanthropy.""  In fact, the author seems mesmerized by the big money and big ideas of these individuals.He singles out Irene Diamond, Ted Turner, Walter Annenberg and George Soros as ""venturesome""  philanthropists -- because they ""imagined, respectively, worlds without AIDS, without strife, without ignorance, and without tyrants, then made massive and immediate financial efforts to make those worlds real""The author acknowledges that it is an uphill battle for these individuals to be creators of ""a new and imaginative era of philanthropy.""  He observes, ""If historical precedent were to hold, foundations would [take] courses [that] would be safe and uncontroversial.""On the war of political ideas and foundations, Dowie writes, ""During the last twenty years of the twentieth century, it was conservatives who prevailed.., financed the Reagan revolution, and provisioned the Republican recapture of Congress.  A dozen or so medium-sized, uncharacteristically patient foundations can take a good deal of credit for the rise and endurance of America's conservative revolution...More recently, following this bold twenty-five-year foray into public policy by right-wing foundations, the Left has stepped timidly into the fray with a few programs in economic and political justice.  Will mainstream foundations, too, learn from the conservative foundations' triumph of leveraged influence?  Or will they continue their minimal, unimaginative funding of safe and soft institutions proposing weak, incremental solutions to urgent and undeniable crises?"" ""Brilliant and constructive as some of their work has been,"" writes Dowie, ""much of it has also been fruitless, uninspired, and designed to do little more than perpetuate the economic and social systems that allow foundations to exist.""He explicitly faults foundations for not doing enough for social movements which they have aided:  ""With the single exception of civil rights, foundation interests in America's signature social movements ? for women's rights, peace, environment, environmental justice, students, gay liberation, and particularly labor ? [have] been parsimonious, hesitant, late, and at times counterproductive...In any case, all foundation support for social movements...remains small potatoes any way it's measured.""  In summation, Dowie argues that ""Those empowered to make grants should not assume that they have the wisdom to solve such serious problems simply because they control the money."" As a student of philanthropy and seeker of foundation largesse for the past 30 years, I can only say, ""Amen!"

There is ""Into Thin Air"" and this book, ""The Climb"" by  Anatoli Boukreev and G. Weston Dewalt which describe in detail this tragedy. I have read both books. By no means will I declare a winner here. I will say Anatoli's description of the details and events which led to this calamity are presented very clearly. When reading ""The Climb"" you recognize the ""Story"" from the eyes of one of the world's great mountaineers. The details are clearly painted for one to recognize and feel the emotions which were experienced there. This is one of the reasons I enjoyed the book.  The next reason was the insight to the ""Man."" Prior to reading this book I was unaware of who exactly Anatoli was. Now I know! I am with sorrow when I learned he had died (not in the book, occurred after publishing). Anatoli was a pioneer, an adventurer and a hero - this you do find in the book.  My negative points with this book are the attempts to cover more than the ""Story"" and the narrative. The authors went on in a few pages, relatively speaking to cover another expedition which Anatoli  had participated in. The title ""The Climb : Tragic Ambitions on Everest"" indicates the reader will learn about the ""Story"" and I assume other tragedies. The other expedition was not a tragedy. The insight to who Anatoli was is absolutely NOT a tragedy. The authors could have ended with their telling of THE tragedy and had the opportunity to write a follow-on book about Anatoli.  Also, I respect the authors desire to include a section which delivered the exact words of Anatoli during a Q&A session. But I do not think it worked for two reasons. First, Anatoli did not justify his position to anyone. He was a hero. Second, the narration was long and the dialect became difficult to read.  Overall, I do recommend this book to those who wish to experience the challenge of Mt.Everest and to learn about a great mountaineer.o wish to experience the challenge of Mt.Everest and to learn about a great mountaineer"

It was okay; the plot is an interesting one I'd have liked to see explored in greater depth, but there weren't many really scary moments. (and if a book prominently featuring evil children can't produce chills than there's definitely something wrong there.)There were few moments, especially in the last few chapters that strained credulity, and the ending was a cliche I unfortunately saw coming from the beginning when a certain object was found in the aftermath of an explosion (and it doesn't help that a quote on the cover tells you straight out it's going to be a cliffhanger).   But despite all this it was entertaining enough to keep my interest and convince me to read it all the way through. I'd recommend it if there's nothing better to be had, and there's of course the chance that fans of this particular genre might enjoy it more than a casual reader"

From Natasha, an overzealous protector of humans and animals, to her mom Stevie, suffering through a perimenopausal crisis, on to Roger, a reclusive millionaire, and ending with the Samoan twosome, Pit and Bigun. The only normal person in this whole bunch is Striker, who can't seem to control Natasha or his temper when dealing with her. The plot is a good one, the mystery one I thought I had figured out but didn't, and the characters fun. Natasha is a young woman trying to deal with a traumatic event from her past in unorthodox ways. I liked her take-on-the-world attitude, and the fact that she's so young. There's more to discover with Natasha and I am looking forwarding to watching her grow as a bodyguard and person.

As with other Siddons novels, the women characters are usually weak in this area.  I was disappointed that it was Sam who made the decision not to do so (by passing out) rather than Cat.  Having been to Italy several times, I found Siddons' descriptions to be very vivid and realistic!  However, for someone having visited Italy for the first time, Cat's knowledge of where she was going was astounding!  She knew the names of all the little villages, towns, etc. without consulting her travel guide!  Wow, what an accomplishment!  She was like a walking/talking guide to Italy!  I had trouble with her character in that she was supposed to be so fearful and withdrawn and then she seemed to be a worldly traveler once she hit Italy.  There was no real progression.  Yes, she had more difficulty in Rome than in Venice, in Venice than in Siena, etc., but I felt that her character change could have been developed in a more progressive manner.  I also felt, as another reviewer, that there was way too much drinking in this novel.  Yes, the wine is wonderful in Italy and sometimes you do end up having a little too much, but this group WAY over did it!  I don't know how they could function through some of the episodes with as much wine as they were supposed to have consumed!  But all in all, I enjoyed the theme of the book.  Cat facing her fears and the changes in the lives of the characters brought on by this trip were an enjoyable journey.  If I could ask Siddons one question, it would be, ""Why are the atrocious, shallow men in your novels the ones the women always fall for?""  I would like her to write one where a strong male character comes through for the female without overshadowing the female character.  I love Siddons style of writing and wish she would address one in this manner, rather than making the women in hernovels appear weak and foolish at their first introduction to some raucous male character!  Up Island is my favorite so far!  Thanks!"

The fact that the book is not seen in the bookstores and out of stock as of now on amazon.com is a very sad affair. Its production and marketing failure by no means reflect the excellent quality (the content, not design/printing) of the book.There are plenty of other C++ books out there, but with the exception of Stroustrup's and Lippman's ""C++ Primer"" they do not cover C++ as systematic, comprehensive, logically making sense, well layed out, and at the appropriate (professional) level as this book does. As such they serve us as more of a tutorial than reference. If you want both a tutorial and a reference, you want the language features described with examples, just like this book does. It is true that not every features are commonly used, but for completeness they need to be layed out and explained. As a previous review noted, if you read this book carefully, perhaps a couple times, you'll be in great shape to deal with most interview questions on C++. (I have personal proof of this in a recent pre-interview C++ coding exam that lasted several hours--solving not toy but professional level problems!)Another criticism on this book is that it has many back and forth references to other pages. Come on now, the book is about a complex programming language, so the cross references are a logical and integral part of the book layout. It appeared to me the people who complained about this followed the references back and forth all the time when they were reading the book. If you go on the web, do you follow each and every link that's available on the page? You'll certainly get lost fast if you do.This leads to another question: Is this book a good first C++ book? Probably not, if C/C++ is completely new to you. Nor is Lippman's ""C++ Primer,"" even though it has the word ""primer"" in its title. However, they are the kind of books that last well beyond the first read (versus those, say, learn such and such in 21 days and many others above that level). If one expects to read through this book once to master C++ as well as the basic OOP for the first time, he is either a genius or bound to be disappointed.In conclusion, this book is a keeper, just like those by Scott Meyers (e.g., Effective C++"

When I graduated from Medical School, it was a painful reality for students such as myself whose ideals were somewhat less concerned with finance then helping patients in pain.  Going beyond using the stethoscope and comforting and reassuring the patient.  It's also tragic that most doctors do become immune after many years.

The variety of mythological stories described in this novel support this claim that Indian culture allows us to appreciate the world that surronds us.  After reading this novel, it is easy to relate to Chofy because of his own personal doubt in himself. There are many times when we as individuals will look into the ""mirror"" and not like or appreciate what is looking back at us. Chofy felt like a failure, because of the life he was leading and the misery he felt. Like all individuals, he yearned for something more, something that could fill the empty void in the mirror. His lusting for Rosa clouded his mind and prevented him from making clear judgements throughout most of this novel. An example of this would be when he went to visit Aunt Wifreda. He was more concerned about making sure Rosa could come and ask questions about Mr. Evelyn Waugh, instead of about her own personal well being. Without this component of the novel, the novel would have never be able to proceed because the thoughts of Evelyn Waugh triggered the thoughts of blindness and Beatrice. This novel relies heavily on seeing through the darkness. Most Indian Mythology is told in a dark sense of reality. The constant questioning of ""could these stories be true"" sort of thing connects a major theme in this novel in blindness. Many of the thoughts and revelations that the characters have in this novel is usually displayed or told in blindness.  This book also displayed how simplistic things have the most complex meaning in Indian culture and mythology. The idea that a person's eyes could be the symbols of emptiness and ignorance lead a person to think and ponder the possibilities of the meaning of life. Indian mythology almost always has a direct connection to nature. Throughout the course of this novel, there were a number of times the power ofnature was emminent. When Beatrice was sick with measeles, it was the power of spirits through nature that helped cure Beatrice. Melville does an excellent job by incorporating thess aspects into her novel because she is doing exactly what an author should do and that is let the reader think critically about what is taking place in the novel, and force the reader to question his or her own beliefs about life.  This book gives great insight into Indian culture, mythology, and personal struggle. A newfound respect and admiration of Indian culture can be achieved by reading and analyzing what Melville has put together in this novel. I would recommend reading this novel because of its relation to the mystery of the human spirit"

(It's difficult to forget Gaspode the Wonder Dog or Cut-me-own-throat Dibbler). It will also introduce you to Pratchett's style of alluding to real-world events.

The story opens at Reesy and Dandre's long awaited wedding but before the \\""I Do's\\"" can be exchanged an incident from the past rears its very UGLY head and the excitement begins.  Files opens a floodgate of drama and it never stops throughout the book.It seems like Reesy's marital woes and personal trauma permeate everyone around her and no one close to her is left unscathed.  In this episode, although the spotlight is primarily on Reesy, it is almost equally shared with some familiar and new supporting characters.  Surprisingly, the dynamic duo, Tyrone and Tyrene (Reesy's high-profile attorney parents), experience a crisis so devastating that their very foundation is threatened, while Reesy's sassy grandmother opens the closet exposing some familial skeletons that are eyebrow-raising (to say the least).  Fans will learn more about Misty's husband, Rick, who has unmentionable issues that threaten their marriage; Dandre's physician father and his fantasies; and a new character, Sleazy, a stand-up comedian, who, despite his stage name, actually comes through in a big way.As with the other Reesy/Misty books, Files upholds her tradition of keeping the novels fresh and funny by interjecting the latest and most hip language, musical references, and urban expressions in her dialogue and settings.  Yet, her appeal continues to be universal as this episode is well written and perfectly paced making it a real page-turner.  It is a perfect release for the summer season and will no doubt be a BIG hit for fans of the series.  I cannot wait until the next release!Reviewed by PhyllisAPOOO BookClubNubian Circle Book Club"

51138056,R100YKAVT7MKFX,B0007ENPKG,395238737,The Case of the Screaming Woman & The Case of the Glamorous Ghost,Books,5.0,0.0,0.0,A Perry Mason Double-Header,"Erle Stanley Gardner (1889-1970) wrote more than one hundred novels over the course of his long career. A trial lawyer himself, Gardner's best known creation was Perry Mason, a flamboyant criminal defense attorney who earns his large fees by virtue of a remarkable talent for using the law to uncover the truth on the witness stand.Although the Perry Mason novels are genre fiction pure and simple, Gardner was at the height of his powers during the 1950s, and this double-header offers two of his best: the 1955 THE CASE OF THE GLAMOROUS GHOST and the 1957 THE CASE OF THE SCREAMING WOMAN.  Written in a dialogue heavy, staccato style that recalls the likes of Hammett, both titles make for fun reading.GHOST is really among the best of Gardner's novels.  Eleanor Corbin is a flighty young woman with a history of getting into \\""scrapes.\\"" And her current one is a dilly: she has been arrested for wandering around a park in a nearly naked state. Mason steps in at the request of her mortified family in an effort to control both Eleanor and the press... but when the headlines break it isn't long before Eleanor finds herself on trial for murder.SCREAMING WOMAN is not quite on the same level with GHOST, but it offers plenty of entertainment nonetheless.  When Mr. Kirby comes home with a wild tale about a beautiful but mysterious stranded motorists, his wife worries that he may have gotten himself into a jam, and retains Mason to show him the error of his ways.  Unfortunately, Mrs. Kirby's instincts are all too correct, and before too long her husband is in the hands of D.A. Hamilton Burger.Laws, police procedure, and forensic science have changed a great deal since these novels were written, but that's actually part of the fun when you read them; they offer a glimpse into a lost era.  And they are fun, often very clever, and now and then unexpectedly memorable.  Recommended as light reading.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"

The children left to continue this heritage are Travis, lacy and mariette. Travis alternately loves the place and hates it. The only certainty is that he beds a slave (who he doesn't want to love) b.Mariette, the youngest, is  selfish, manipulative who I am happy to say eventually gets what she deserves. Lacy is our scarlett o'hara. She loves the land and is devoted to it and the people on it. A likeable, love character. Enter Travis, a man from the east, who is hard not to love. A strong, tender character. They fall in love but amid the many problems threatening the existence of the plantation, lacy has to choose between travis and swans watch...........and he loses. Eventually Travis returns to SW which he comes to love and they are happily together. Travis runs north to marry and live with his slave which in pre-civil war south was unheard of. Thisis pretty much a one night read. I can't rightly explain why I disliked it so much.....or why, waiting for it to get better, I even finished the book.

21753344,R2MIA6G3IEZOI2,1931841233,472548362,Game Programming All in One (The Premier Press Game Development Series),Books,2.0,6.0,7.0,Book Leaves MUCH to be desired.,"When I purchased this book a year ago, I thought to myself, ""Finally, I will learn how to create games under Windows using DirectX""; I still wish that I had that thought.  This book is hefty, and you would think that it would contain information which you can use. The reason why I gave it 2 stars instead of one is because there is some information which I found useful, but it had nothing to do with programming at all.I know C++ already, and his very brief primer would leave much for the casual gamer to desire. Here is a hint: Pick up a \\""Sams Teach Yourself C++ in 21 Days\\"" book and study it before attempting to understand this book. You get to build ConLib, which is a library for making a Console-based game. While this is interesting, you learn absolutely nothing. By nothing, I mean, he throws code at you without explaining why you want to do something, and it's all Object Oriented. The OOP is not bad in itself, that's a very sound technique, but if you did not understand his brief tour of C++ and classes, then you would do well to stop and take my suggestion as stated above.Leading up to actual windows programming starts smoothly, but then again the author, manages to bungle things.  You get code tossed in your face, with barely any explanations as to why you want to do something a certain way. This certainly does not help me learn or teach me anything.  Since I already knew the basics about creating a Win32 Application (just not wrapping it in a class), I pushed on to begin to develop \\""Mirus.\\""This is a joke if ever I have seen one. The author states that you will build this game engine, and yet, he leaves too much out to understand what you are doing. Again more code explodes before your eyes, and you learn...nothing, at least I did not. The author does not explain anything (yet again, am I repeating myself?) and does not stop for questions or much of a review. You are shown example code; however he does not tell you where to place it inyour files, let alone why you want to do a certain thing this way. He defines methods, and then tells you to complete them. I hardly consider this helpful. He provides no guidance. I thought I was going to build ""Mirus"" step by step, so I might learn how; instead he gives you a few lines, and skips onto the next topic. Thankfully, that inane process of coding comes to an end, but not quite completely.After finishing ""Mirus"" (which I never actually made), he talked about (yet again briefly), Nodes, Trees, and Linked Lists, Math, and Physics. This is probably the BEST part of the entire book. Why? It has several useful equations. Even though he uses the same type of presentation as before, you don't need to read his comments to understand the formulas, not too much at least.  Most of his explanations are perplexing, and I had to look up things on the web to better understand them. He does at least mention how to do basic Artificial Intelligence for a guard, by giving them a pattern to walk, and then how to ""listen"" and ""see"" you and how to react.  That part was all very well done.Near the end of the book (just about) you build some arkanoid/bricks type game using the now finished \\""Mirus\\"" engine. Of course his method of teaching is still as spotty as ever, and if you have learned anything from my book, then you have my deepest respect.He does mention how to get into the gaming industry, and how difficult it is. You will have to use the ""Try and try again"" method.  So, there is hope for me yet!Overall, this book taught me nothing. The only reason I keep it is because there are some formulas in there that I just know will come in handy some day. There are Formulas relating to how to add gravity, and where the center of mass of a given body is. Other functions like Velocity and rotations. My biggest complaint and I probably sound like a broken record by now, is that as many others have said he justgives you code, and expects you to understand it. This entire book feels rushed. I would have waited another year or two for it to have been completed. Everything just feels as if he hurriedly would work on something, and then has to stop that abruptly and work on something else. It feels more like I am reading his notes, than a real book.  The typographical errors do not help either, and they also prevent you from learning.  Maybe this book is too advanced for me, but I am not unintelligent person when it comes to programming.Avoid this book if you can help it, if you bought it and like it then I am happy for you, but I cannot like a book that I spent $$$ on and failed to learn a shred of programming.  I prefer the ""How and Why"" method over the ""Monkey see, Monkey do"". In this world where code is supposed to be reusable, I can understand that, but if you don't understand how or why something works, then you will not understand what happens when something breaks.  Simply showing some code and expecting me to learn, does not happen. I have to know why I do something, why do I have to do this. Why is this better than that?  How does this work?  Those questions were never answered to my satisfaction in this book at least.  The Bottom Line: You are better off finding FREE tutorials on DirectX 8.x/9 from places like Drunken Hyena, and others if you do a Google search"

It sets examples of courage, strength, trust, and hope.  Originally, the rabbits already had place of their own in which they lived.  One of them had a bad feeling that something terrible was going to happen  if they stayed.  He was able to convince only a few others that they had to  leave the warren soon to find a safer place to live. Going against the  others, against all odds, they set forth on their journey. Once they left  their homeland, they ran into numerous obstacles that stood in their way.   The rabbits were confronted with many dangerous events such as; crossing  rivers, roads, escaping from predators, and venturing through deep woods,  all in hopes to find a safe new place to live.  At one point in their  adventures, they were welcomed into a warren already occupied by other  rabbits, but had decided to continue on to find a warren of there own.   Eventually, the rabbits found a place they had been dreaming of.  A  wonderful place called Watership Down, found at the very top of a large  hill.  The rabbits loved it there; they were able to look out over the  entire valley.  Although they had found their paradise, something seemed to  be missing.  They were lacking doe rabbits in which they would need to  reproduce, and keep their clan alive.  Once again, they set forth on yet  another journey to gather some does to bring back to their warren. The  rabbits were able to locate some does in a hutch at a nearby farm, but were  unsuccessful in the attempt to free them.  In fact, Hazel, the main  character, was nearly killed in doing so.  They had to look for does  somewhere else.  It wasn't long before they stumbled upon a warren; they  would soon come to learn it was a very bad place.  The ruler of the warren  was the evil General Woundworth.  This would be the most difficult  challenge the rabbits had toencounter in all their adventures.  A plan was  made to gather some of the does from the warren. Bigwig, the leader,  falsely joined into General Woundworth's clan in hope of persuading some of  them to run away with him.  After a well drawn out plan, and the extremely  difficult defeat of the General and his captions, they were at last able to  help some of the rabbits in the warren escape to find their freedom.   The  most interesting thing about this story is the way the rabbits look at  death.  They believe in the Black Rabbit of Inle, which is \\""fear and  everlasting darkness.\\"" The black rabbit will come and get you when it is  your time to go with him, when it is your time to die.  It is said that \\""he  will come in the night and call a rabbit by name.\\"" When one goes with him,  they will have no more pain, be rid of all their weaknesses, they will be  free.  This black rabbit is thought to be working with the Lord Frith,  which is their lord.  They work together to bring about what was meant to  be.  Both the Black Rabbit and their Lord Frith were spoken of continuously  in the story, which shows concern for death, and their belief in the  heavens.  At the end of the story the black rabbit sets an example of what  happens to a rabbit when he come to take Hazel with him.  He is finally set  free"

When a monkey is taken, he narrowly escapes, but not before being injured and simultaneously damaging part of the computer.  As the robots seek to fix it, they discover that the only way it can repair itself is through a crystal, which in turn, is honored by the monkeys.  Let the monumental struggle begin!  Technology vs. nature, survival of the fittest, the old quote from the English Romantics, \\""We murder to dissect.\\""  Even though it is a quick read, I encourage you to read through it a number of times and enjoy Kochalka's work and its thought provoking story.

Avi has a unique writing style that no other author has.      In this book, Phillip Malloy recieves a new homeroom teacher. He just assumes that she is mean for the simple fact that she describes herself as being strict. Phillip tries everything to get out of her class. One little thing that he decides to do blows up into a national wide explosion! He almost sabbotoges everyone's lives because of this one teacher! Everyone believes that Phillip was wrongly suspended for showing patriotism, but only a few people know the truth! You have to read to understand exactly what I mean.     The characters are not really explained in the book. Once you start to read you feel like youv'e known the characters for ever. You start to feel how they would if they were real. You also feel that you are a part of the story because it just draws you in.     If you like surprises you WILL LOVE this book because you never know what will happen! Because you feel like a part of the book, one minute you're in the ass. principals office then you're talking to a reporter! Nothing in the beginning of the book can compare to what happens in the last few sentences of the book. The book has a surprise ending that no one would ever suspect this book has a lot of ironic things happening!     As I said Avi has a writing style all of his own! He uses sentences that might confuse you at first, but then you'll understand why his writing is this way. I really enjoyed this book I hope I have encouraged you to read this fasinating book!"

Much of the book is about the growth of the comic book industry and its role in American propoganda preceding and during WW2 but to say that this is a book about the golden age of the comic book industry would be missing the point.  Much of the book is also about the central character's dream of rescuing his family from Hitler's war machine but again to say that this is a book about Jewish American families preceding and during WW2 would be missing the point.   Much of the book is about one character's search for his sexual identity in a society that was not tolerant but to say that this is a book about a gay man's life in the 1940s would be missing the point.  As other reviewers note, this is a long and meandering work that earned the author a Pulitzer Prize.   Chabon writes beautifully and this reader found himself lost in world of  historical fiction in which this work is set.  The pace is terrific and the story is not only entertaining but educational.This is the first Chabon book I have read.   I plan to read all of his other work now which I suppose says it all"

As Mickey would say ""Indian territory"".  Mickey's father had a passion for baseball and started Mickey off at an early age.  This is where he learned to switch hit.  As a young man he met a woman named Merlyn.  They met at a friend's house one night and asked her out.  ""We were together ever since then"", said Mickey.  Mickey was brought up to the Yankees with a series of lucky events.  Scouts would be looking at other players and noticed that Mickey was the one who stood out.  Mickey was first suited up in 1951, he was just a kid.  Mickey started a habit with drinking on the off seasons.  Mickey said he never really got to know his own family.  Mickey's father died a few years into his career.  This was a huge blow.  His 18 year career was played with many injuries.  He'd be known for playing injured on most occasions.  Behind his award-winning career, Mickey said that the most important award to him was the Most Valuable Player award.  ""This award let you know that you were the best player in baseball for that year"", he had said.  In 1969, Mickey said goodbye to baseball.  Baseball had treated him good and it was time for him to leave.  Mickey said it was the worst day of his life except for the day his dad died.  His baseball was all Mickey knew.  He slowly walked away from baseball, but he had  a short announcing career that wasn't for Mickey even though he saw his close friends become very good at it.  Mickey would tell you many stories about the past and good times with his friends.  The jokes they play with each other and late nights spent at the bars.  Mickey seemed to be a person that i'd get along with.  Mickey would also tell stories about the Yankee players and give you a little insight on the team.  He told each person their strengths and weaknesses.  He would talk about old pals and what kind of  trouble they'd get themselves into and they'd find away to get themselves out.There wasn't much that I didn't like about the book.  I thought on some  subjects he wouldn't get into too much detail and it felt like he left you hanging.  He also would go back in time and go ahead and confuse you. This book was one of the best books that I ever read.  I also love the game of baseball and look up to players like Mickey Mantle.  You hear stories about ball players and they sound almost as good as hearing it from the man himself.  I enjoyed reading about Mickey and if you're a baseball lover, like me, you'll love this book.  If you like sports this is also a good book and if you're a Yankees fan, you'll be sure to like this book too"

It is easy to dismiss Gorky's mature style as just the latest Abstract Expressionist fashion when in fact it preceded many of that movement's most important works, serving in the process as a bridge from surrealism to abstract expressionism.  Perhaps more than any other contemporary abstract painters, Gorky's background is crucial in terms of understanding his artistic vision. As such, Matossian does an incredible job of giving the reader the entire scope of this background, sometimes to the point of tedium.  The book,however, though over 500 pages long, has an easy pace to it for the most part, and definitely lets the reader in on what surely must have been one of the most frustrating lives, from beginning to end, of any major artist in the 20th century.  Gut-wrenching at times, Matossian's portrait of Gorky's life is a miracle: juxtaposing the lyrical work he produced with the unfortunate string of incidents that plagued this sensitive human being.  If you are interested in understanding more about Arshile Gorky, then the sheer scope of this undertaking is a great place to start"

Sometimes that realization doesn't come until after you complete reading the book, which didn't seem all that profound while you were getting through it, however at the end it hits you.  Such as is the case with this very unsettling novel \\""The Corrections.\\""The story is in many ways a narrative of the Lambert family, comprised of patriarch Alfred, his wife Enid and offspring Gary, Denise and Chip. While Enid and Alfred have been married for decades, it's safe to say that the family is horribly dysfunctional.The story reflects on the history of the family and mostly on the impact of Alfred on the rest of his family.  His decisions and choices in life impact the others for decades on end and provide the basis for the entire book.Along the way the author touches on a number of hot button subjects including dementia, caring for the aged, drug abuse, mental illness, drug therapies to treat mental illness, stock manipulaton and greed, sexual feelings and actions of various stripes, the irrational expectations that families place on its members, parenting and an overall examination of the meaning of life.The author weaves this story with a mix of humor and irony that sometimes is overwrought but it is compelling.  I've noticed that a number of reviewers have complained about the characters in the book but that's probably because there are plenty of kernels of truth in this book that probably remind people too much of their own lives.The book made my very uncomfortable a number of times and I'm still grappling with some of its implications.  The issues of caring for aged parents and the sometimes related issue of mental health among seniors is not an easy subject to confront.  Luckily the book intersperses the uncomfortable with humor, but don't pick this book up if all you want is sweetness and light.Overall, I recommendthe book and applaud the author for his courageous examination of these issues"

If I had to rate it for the romance, which was practically nonexistent, I would give it a big round ZERO.Unlike many of her previous and absolutely wonderful romances, this novel was purely based on plot. While she did delve into the hero and heroin's characterization, it was a desultory job compared to her earlier work. Sadly Judith Mcnaught has left the genre of Romance and have been writing suspense/mystery novels-that possess a dash of romance, for the last couple of years.The plot is pretty simple: A famous heroine loses her husband to the hands of a murderer; the hero-a shady character from the past, appears to her aid, while the NYPD are adamant on nailing the hero in jail due to his previous run-ins with the law and his sudden connection to the heroin's life.While the story kept you turning the page in order to find out who the murderer was, it fell flat on the plausibility of the heroin's feelings of love towards a man she barely knew while erasing her deceased husband's memory in a mere 3 months. This was the downfall of the book and I regret to say that after the heroine declares her love for the hero, I stopped caring about the whole book as a whole.Judith should have left the romance out, which would have been a more successful novel. Her other choice was to do what she did in \\""Perfect\\"":Develop a deep characterization that centers on a gut-wrenching romance, while developing a shallow mystery that would hold the story together and keep it going.If you are a Judith Mcnaught fan, do not bother with this novel.

Like the Da Vinci Code, Angels and Demons has amazing suspense and thrilling and mind-twisting endings up until the last page. This book I think is very controversial to any Christian reader, but I think that we should all step outside our own religion bubble, to just see how amazing it is to watch people try and destroy something so well established. I think Dan Brown is a writer that I totally disagree with in terms of the religious aspects, but one of my favorites because of simply the way he writes the book. I also think that it is important to see his view as an author; why would he write something like this? As a Christian, it would be hard for me to believe in such things as illuminati, corruption of the church, etc, and I think that Brown writes these things so that we can all see from the outside, and to be a little more open-minded. Even through all this, I still recommend his books, not to believe in what he says, but to enjoy his style of writing"

She wrote in a living room full of extended family,she wrote longhand when paper was not so plentiful as it is today and mistakes could not be so frequently wadded up and tossed to the landfill, she wrote without the instant editing afforded by personal computers, she wrote without benefit of the MFA programs and workshops we are assured today are the only route to producing literary art, and yet she wrote beautifully and for all time.  Every word counts, every character is real, every scene pulses along in a swift current.  Her work can be many things at once: social satire, romance, social criticism, a comedy of manners.  It is a portrait of a certain society in a certain time, it is a universal commentary on human foibles, gender relations, class and money.      NORTHANGER ABBEY was one of Austen's earliest mature works, and it stands alongside PRIDE AND PREJUDICE and the rest.  She does something different in this one: she uses her own novel to, among other things, satirize the popular literature of her time, especially Ann Radcliffe's MYSTERIES OF UDOLPHO.  She sets out telling us that her protagonist, Catherine Morland, is not your typical heroine, that in fact she's ordinary without special talents, a dramatic home life or heart-stopping beauty.  She belongs to the audience that was vacuuming up the burgeoning genre of popular literature of her time, and the second half of the story largely finds her attempting to live like a heroine in her favorite gothic romance, only to have reality jump out of the closet at her at every turn.  The first half of the story is the set up for the second, the comedy of manners that positions her in the company of the residents of Northanger Abbey, whose name conjures up in her mind a dramatic ruin of a castle.  There is, in fact, quite a bit of suspense that keeps you up late, just not the kind Catherine has in mind. If you pay attention in the first half of the book, you will find the \\""guns\\"" neatly planted that go off in the last act"

Not Cassie, Rachel! also the crocs were way to small, now I can  be forgiving about that part because of the difficulty of filming with a  large croc, but come on!! wake up America! Demand that the show stick true  to the book series. I know I am. Fight the stupididty of TV executives!

I  felt I was being talked to as a child and that I would have a hard time  following his basics teachings, which frankly are the basic of basics.  I  almost felt insulted!  If you are just starting out and having a hard time  grasping the concept of wicca, or you are a young person, I would suggest  this book.  If you are an adult starting out, I'm sure you will not enjoy  this book as you will find it seems that scott is talking to you like you  are an infant.  I would suggest a book like ""Green Witchcraft""   by Aoumiel.  If you are also a long time practicioner and wanting to see  what the all the 'hype' is about this book (I heard about it on a email  list and got numberous recomendations to check this book out), I suggest  not to spend your money.

It took place within a time frame of about 3 days so technically according to the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit I think the killer is a spree killer actually...(details). The killer while just as vague as you would expect one to be in a mystery thriller does get some development...most notably through the comparisons to him and the killer in the ""Crimes in Old New York"" book. One thing this book is definitely not lacking in is character development. Lincoln Rhyme is probably one of my favorite characters in fiction. He acts like a real person with thought, contradiction, and emotion fueling his character. It's amazing that he is just a product of the author's imagination. Amelia Sachs complements his character very well but isn't merely just playing back-up to Rhyme...she is truly her own character. Probably one of my favorite scenes in the whole book is when the action breaks for a second and Sachs and Rhyme sit down and talk. Sharing parts of their lives that they never shared with anyone. Wow...it's touching without being overly emotional. Lest you think that there is no action in this book, let me set you straight. This is one of the most tensioned-filled books I've read. My favorite scene is probably the church scene. That one will make you sweat! Of course there is a twist ending...but it's believeable. And completely unexpected. Jeffery Deaver took some risks by shying away from the tired out serial killer mold with this novel..and I'm glad he did"
52170873,RM1BT5A1V7PFU,0374172897,785940945,The Hours: A Novel,Books,4.0,1.0,1.0,"artistic, intelligent, humane (but in what order)?","I held off on ""The Hours"" for some time despite it's initial warm reception because I could see how easily it could be one of those books that everyone else loves, but that might seem a little too precious  for my taste.  This book might out-Woolff Woolff, with a mimeographic  slavishness to the source and its style; it might stray so far from her  that the connection would seem overblown, a mere literary conceit for its  own sake.  The frequent focus on the sufferings of the gay characters might  turn it into gay polemnic.As it turns out, both my faith and distrust  were mis-laid.  Cunningham does a masterful job of avoiding all these  potneital pitfalls.  He also immediately drew me into the story: the first  thirty pages or so of this book contain some of the most marvellous writing  I've ever encountered.  I was quite literally ooh-ing and ahh-ing and  chukling out loud at its economy and power.  I doubt that anyone could have  sustained that quality for much longer, yet there is  a slight  disappointment at the drop-off.  By cutting between stories, Cunningham has  found a smartly flexible strategy of ""triangulating"" Woolf,  through his more modern heroines (these novellas may actually be stronger  for their interrupting of each other), but most readers will still benefit  from a quick review of ""Mrs. Dalloway""--the first several pages,  at least--to appreciate the ways that Cunningham approaches and avoids his  source material.  As for my concern that this would be a ""gay""  novel--yes, whatever that means--Cunningham invites a response much like  the one I have to Toni Morrison's characters, who are first and foremost  strong and interesting people who can reach across demographic boundaries  through their sheer humanity.So: despite avoiding these potentially  lethal pitfalls--in fact turning them into strengths--Cunningham makes one  major mis-step:  one of the three stroies, while constructed of well  written sentences and some keen observations, never quite gets off the  ground for me--it seems to stop rather than to end, and leaves the whole  book coming up a bit short (for me anyway).  Cunningham after all, does  seem to be working with miniatures here, and we may rightfully expect a  higher degree of polish here than we would in a big baggy novel.  It just  seemed odd to me that he did some of the very difficult things terribly  well and then stumbled with what should have been the simpler task of plot  construction--as if a trapeze artist gave a stunning performance and then  immediately walked into a telephone pole.I don't want to turn-off  potential readers--this is a book I'll likely read again--so much as offer  a perspective that's neither the one-star dismissal or the five-star  salivation.  And those first thirty (27?) pages were truly one of the  highlights of my reading life"

Well, that is how I felt with Gerald's Game by Stephen King.  The title was a little deceiving to me at first.  I figured it was a book about a mass murderer that would first play games with his victims and then go on a killing spree. But I was really surprised to find out that it had nothing to do with that.  I figured out that the title was actually very self-explanatory after reading the first couple of pages.  To shortly summarize the book, it was about a husband and a wife that took an over night trip to their summer cabin.  The couple, Gerald and Jessie Burlingame liked to play \\""kinky\\"" games.  The games got to be too much for Jessie and she started to get uncomfortable playing them.  She became really worried when her husband would not stop even after she asked him to.  At this point I was really enjoying the book.  It kept me in suspense the whole time.  Not to forget, the way Stephen King tends to describe the smallest details.  Him doing so helps you get a picture in your mind of what is going on.  But then Mr. King threw in something that I think he over did. He made Jessie start hearing different voices in her head.  These voices were her different personalities that wanted to come out but could not.  At this point I got somewhat confused because he talked about Goodwife Burlingame, the \\""good\\"" girl and a voice named Ruth, the \\""bad\\"" girl in her.  Goodwife Burlingame was the voice telling her to, \\""Let hem do it, Jessie.  Let him shoot his squirt. It's that stuff in his balls that's making him crazy, and you know it.  It makes them all crazy.\\""  On the other hand, Ruth was the one that kept telling her, \\""The game's, not mine. We don't have to play it again, Jess, if you don't want to.\\""  Again, Mr. King described the voices so well that he helped me find my way back.  But even with her struggling to stop him, her husband still continued to \\""play\\"".  The more she tried to stop him the more she realized that he was not playing anymore.  The voices in her head then made her panic and to protect herself she accidentally pulled her feet back and ended up kicking him where no man wants to be kicked.  Like most other murder books, he falls to the floor and dies.  All this happened within the first chapter.  Mr. King put too much into the first chapter that he did not have much left to put into the rest of the book.   At the end of the first chapter and beginning of the second, Jessie came to realize what she had done.  This is were I started to loose interest because Mr. King gave too many details on what Jessie was thinking.  Not only did I loose interest but I even got bored because she kept repeating herself over and over.  Her multiple personalities kept debating and this continued for almost the rest of the book.  Stephen King broke up the continuation of her thoughts by explaining the way she struggled to get a drink of water from a glass that was near the bed.  Here again, he gave great description and did a great job because there is not much you can do while trying to get a drink of water when you are still handcuffed to a bed. He finally gets to a point were he lets Jessie think clearer.  This caught my attention again because the way he made her get out of the cuffs was real \\""scary story\\"" material.  Mr. King then did what I he should have done all together.  In the last couple of chapters he lets Jessie write her thoughts down journal form. This was better than he telling what she was thinking was because it let me see it through her eyes.  Overall Stephen King could have done better with this book.  I felt as if I was on a rollercoaster ride because the story line would get real good but then he would drag it out too long that it would fall straight down.  If he would have shortened the book by shortening Jessie's thoughts or putting them all into journal form at the end, the book would not have dragged out so long.  It made it seem like it rattled on and on in some places but Stephen King, being the great writer that he is, compensated in other parts of the book"

I expected Reynolds to pick up the concept of the plague in ""Chasm City"" earlier. I expected him to do more with it, creating some kind of dark doom-gloom world encapsuled in Chasm City.Instead the first 300 pages tur out to deliver a mediocre story with only the ""Sky Haussmann"" parts moving above the ordinary.The weapons (smart bullets for instance) could have worked if Reynold had written a parody. The lead character could have been someone to like if he would have been less flat. If you introduce someone falling from one stupid mistake into another, at least give hem (or her) some characteristics with which you enjoy even the most stupid decisions made. The main character has neither sense of humour, wit, charm or anything else. Reynolds does nothing new or amazing here. It is as if he picks up some great ideas, but never deliveres. The story--to me--is slow. Why a manhunt when you can explore the city? Why make technology so damn unpractical, unless you want to parody fellow writers? Why use ""revenge"" as a leading motive? Why is this ""revenge"" part so superficially presented? Etcetera. I still am curious to what extends the promises of weirdness--not delivered--in ""Chasm City"" could lead. Maybe Reynolds could visit that area again, while dropping the ""need"" to present ""a story"". With the elements he introduces but ""does not use"", the story could write itself"

But by the time this fact was discovered, Camilla was promised to Lord Harry Summerton, and her conscience wouldn't let her do other than marry Harry. For thirteen years she was a happy wife, until the day Harry persisted in riding an untried horse known to be a rogue, and to attempt this folly in a thunderstorm. Of course, the horse promptly threw the rider, and Harry died instantly.  Camilla had not returned to London society during the next two years, but now, during the celebrations surrounding the peace of 1814, as well as the engagement of the Princess Charlotte to the Prince of Orange, Camilla returns to Society.During an evening gala at Carlton House, she discovers a pair of young lovers, who will play an important part in her own future: Miss Sophie Arenburg and William de Marne, heir to the Earl of Highnam. Sophie is the ward of Czar Alexander of Russia, who is coming to England very soon, now for the festivities. The Earl of Highnam is hopeful of a Marquissate, but scandal could derail his hopes, and anyway, William has been betrothed to Alice Penshill since little more than out of his cradle. Sophie knows, but chooses to ignore the fact that she is about to be betrothed to Prince Ludwig of Prussia.Camilla's best friend for many years, Lady Elizabeth Oxforth, daughter of the Earl of Highnam, has a well-deserved reputation as considerably more than a flirt, although her husband apparently, and continually, just looks the other way.  Actually, he's more occupied with the gambling activities at his club. Elizabeth keeps hinting at something concerning Dominic, the Earl of Ennismount but Camilla doesn't want to hear it, when suddenly, threats and counterthreats send Sophie to Camilla for protection from Dominic and his aunt, who have been named the English protectors of the young lady until the Czar's arrival.The entire troup of players (not all known to each other, either) remove to Camilla's Gloustershire estate, Camilla and Dominic having declared an uneasy truce over the underlying currents of their former attraction for each other. Sophie and William are unable to keep away from each other, thereby setting into motion the final action which will wreak havoc on everyone.It takes a good bit of diplomacy and conversation before all the old ghosts are finally laid to rest, but finally, Sophie and William are allowed to marry, and William's father not only gets a higher title, he makes it all the way to Duke!

Written in the mid 1980s, in the last years before his death, they are that mix of bittersweet memory, melancholy, and joy taken in the here and now. Living with poet Tess Gallagher in a house overlooking the Strait of Juan de Fuca in Washington (Carver grew up in Yakima, Washington), he writes of the days that pass there, the frequent rains and the boats passing on the water, and he tracks the course of fleeting emotions, often triggered by long-forgotten memories.He has this ability to discover the extraordinary in the absolute ordinary, and he can bring together ideas with images drawn from everyday life that disturb and shock the heart, as when he recalls an old relationship while describing the drops and smears of blood left in a kitchen sink after gutting fish. As with his stories, these poems are written in plain, conversational language while evoking at the same time the darkly inexpressible. Simple and direct on the surface, they are like being in a small boat on deep waters"

However, this visitor is different.  Abigail Weston offers to pay James to teach her about sex.  James' younger brother Michael informs him that Abigail is the younger half sister of Lord Jerold Marbleton, a prig. Intrigued by a woman for the first in years, James goes to the meeting place and demands she explain why she wants to hire him.  Abigail tells him that her younger sister Caroline, who she raised, is on the husband market, but fearful of sex.  Abigail wants to talk to her sibling with knowledge, but knows nothing.  James accepts the job of tutoring Abigail in every thing she wants to know about sex but is afraid to ask.  As they fall in love, social and family pressures make a permanent relationship seem impossible. LOVE LESSONS is an erotic Regency romance that is fun to read though the plot moves at a leisurely pace throughout the novel.  The characters are a discernible group with easy to identify personalities.  However, readers are required to have an initial leap of faith that Abigail would have the courage to ask James for lessons, but once that jump is made, Cheryl Holt's tale will remind readers of Susan Johnson's SEDUCTION IN MIND.Harriet Klausner"

This is my second book from Nicole Jordan and it'll most likely be my last. I had to force myself to finish this one (hoping it would get better). The introduction of Aurora's character was so far afield from what she regressed into throughout the novel. Initially she struck you as an interesting if not courageous personality... then she became self-righteous and over-dramatic, going around and round for CHAPTERS with the same insecurities and arguments about the type of person she thought Nicholas was. Literally CHAPTERS are spent in Aurora's emotional angst over how adventurous, ""violent"" or at the very least interesting Nicholas' character was to the detriment of Aurora's ""independence"" (i.e. living by herself fearing what everyone thinks-striving for a boring and shallow life). In fact shallow is a great adjective to explain the overall plot. The explanation of her physical and emotional abuse by her father was so weak that it didn't really substantiate the melodrama that ensued as a result of it. And once her father was introduced, the entire situation was not as dynamic as one would have expected. I can't believe that such a strong male character evolved while the female character regressed into such an irritating drama-queen. All in all, quite a disappointment"
23419250,R28D3NEIA4WTIB,0425098478,986630902,The One Minute Manager,Books,4.0,1.0,2.0,Good Behavioral Psychology,"This book provides a concise, easy-to-read overview of the basic principles of behavioral psychology.  The book concentrates on three basic principles: goal setting, praising, and reprimands; however, the key point to all three of these being effective is clear communication and understanding between the manager and the employee.  The one-minute goal setting is an effective tool in any setting.  The authors recommend writing down the goals of any project or employee responsibility on one sheet of paper in 250 words or less, with a copy provided for review to both the manager and the employee for occasional review.  This is contracting with the employee for the desired results and has been shown to be quite effective in several behavioral psychology clinical trials.The one-minute praisings also work across disciplines.  Providing brief, positive, immediate feedback reinforces the desired behavior.  Again, clinical trials have proven this to be effective.  The authors do a good job of reminding managers to actually do this and to do it in a timely manner.  Studies have also shown that the longer the time delay between the desired behavior and the positive reinforcement dilutes the effectiveness of the reinforcement.  The authors could have done a better job reinforcing the point that managers must be present to observe the desired behavior.The one-minute reprimands work similarly as the one-minute praisings and, again, must be tied temporally to the undesired behavior in order to have the greatest effect.  Here, again, the authors could have done a better job reinforcing that the managers must be present to observe the undesired behavior and that the reprimands should only be used once it is clear to the manager that the employee knows the desired behavior and how to do it prior to the reprimand.As a pediatrician, I am often trying to teach my patients' parents several of these same principles in regards to child-rearing, i.e. how to get a child to stay in bed, sitting at the dinner table and actually eating, etc.  In the future, I will recommend this book to my parents along with 1-2-3 Magic: Effective Discipline for Children 2-12 by Thomas W.

Her truths are  direct and real; the music of this poetry carries forward straight to the  soul.

Sometimes we are moved by single syllable beats, ""Bird song/sing  bird/as you melt/My soul away from this.""

Singing with this  virtuosic sense of rhythm, Ms. Barkley's brings her messages straight to  us...messages of her search for herself, her identity as a black woman, her  sense of who she is and her desire to right social injustice.   Some of  these poems are exhortations in the style of Lucille Clifton, ""Go  young children/and learn/Seek out/those things/which make your  spirits/burn/Just go/Learn.""

It is an account of the main character's life and more specifically of his romantic endavour. It is a slow and intimist story.The narrator starts by by telling his first loves and the story goes back to the present. Because the character is given enough psychological depth, we get to understand better his frustration (the feeling that the life he lives is not his) and dilemna (following his love and true feeling or leaving his life as it is). It is a perfectly fine book, however I wasn't grabbed by the story as I had been grabbed by other books from the same author. Part of it comes from the fact that the story line is a little flat and banal in my opinion and at times indulges in plain sentimentalism. While the characters are admirably built for the most part, the story lacks the youthful frankness of ""Norwegian book"" and the fantastic elements of ""spoutnik Sweetheart"". There are many similar themes however: remaining true to one's feeling, love for an unreachable woman, suicide and music.

I found it hard to follow the author's style and would have preferred more precision in his language.  The drawings may be clear to the author but they were very confusing to me. I am not a bad artist and would find it impossible to create real life models from those drawings, many of which are a mess.

His dream cost so much that his family lived in poverty and he suffered in debtor's prison. Yet his dream was not only to make rubber, but also to reap the wealth of controlling its creation and distribution; when others tried to lay claim to the manufacture of his miracle, only a lawsuit as argued by the famous Daniel Webster could settle the dispute once and for all. The Goodyear Story is a fascinating, true-life tale of science, business, and the striving of human nature against great odds and adverse circumstances"

The English aristocracy that had much in the way of titles but dwindling wealth to support the oftentimes-decaying estates where vast land acreage no longer supported the required upkeep. Feeling as though she had jumped from the frying pan into the fire, Sophia was determined to marry for love, no matter what title her dear mama would try to force upon her.  As fate would have it, across the crowded room, a hush fell, a body moved, and Sophia gazed upon a work of art - the most devastatingly handsome man, His Grace, the Duke of Wentworth.  The whispers began again, with Sophia hearing  `dangerous duke', nightmare, heartbreaker, stay away etc.James, the Duke of Wentworth, had vowed to never marry, to control his baser instincts, and dark passionate nature inherited from his ancestors that would drag him into a dark inhuman hell on earth. Keeping to himself as he did, he could not but be impressed by the very stunning, vivacious, and `wealthy' American and as Sophia glanced up and caught his gaze their eyes met and locked in titillating moment of acknowledgement.  And so the die was cast....This was my introduction to one of the finest books I have had the pleasure to read this year.  The very sensual layers of imagery laid the foundation of what would become one of the more pleasurable love stories I have read with refreshingly bright, intelligent and original dialogs. I started smiling from the very first chapter and thoroughly enjoyed the courtship.  Soon enough the honeymoon was over and when James reverted to a `beastly' cool English peer of the realm, Sophia continued to love him and had her work cut out to act the part of his `Duchess' but in her own estimable way, and perseverance she brought him, and his family, back from darkness into a world of light and love!  This was a truly outstanding romance and one I can highly recommend.  Do keep your tissues handy when you get toward the very moving and sensual ending!light and love!

The first is to make the case that we have no alternative to restructuring the economy if we want economic progress to continue in the decades ahead. The second is to describe not only the broad structure of the eco-economy, but some of its details. And the third is to outline a strategy for getting from here to there in the time available.It sketches the need to move to an eco-economy based on renewable energy and an approach to materials use that mirrors the natural cyclical processes. It also reinforces the systemic nature of change, involving deep changes in societal attitudes, linked to cooperation between government, community and business.Chapter 4 The Shape of the Eco-Economy offers some interesting predictions about the industries and professions that are likely to expand, and to act as drivers in the move towards sustainability. This is in support of his point that, far from the move being a threat to our economic health, it offers vast opportunities for investment and for true economic development"

The author, himself an experienced chess player and administrator (and top pure mathematician), evidently knows a lot of the current players personally.There are a few minor quibbles -- there seems little point in including historic figures like King John and Queen Elizabeth I simply because there's an obscure chess connection.  A better idea would be to have a ""Chessplaying Celebrities"" entry where they could be listed together.  There is also a lack of Southern hemisphere greats, e.g. IM Ortvin Sarapu, 20 times New Zealand Champion, and GM Daryl Johanson of Australia (a strong IM when this book was published).Another problem is the age of the book, if one is looking for info on the current chess scene (of course this is not the author's fault).  There is nothing on the great Shirov or current World Champion Kramnik , and only three lines on the great Anand.  An update would also need a section on the Internet.These quibbles aside, the articles on historical top players are  very good, there are good B&W photos, and an amusing extract from the great annotator Marco.One thing that makes this encyclopedia stand out is the list of lieftime scores between various players.  Divinsky also provides his Keene's assessment of ""all-time greatness"", which may be questionable but he provides the results so people can judge for themselves"

The 50 poems are neatly divided into three thematic sections, each spotlighting a different chapter of a woman's life: family matters, romance, the betrayals of the body. These sections are tightly and cleverly held together by a sewing motif which weaves its way throughout the poems. The reader will find much humor here as well as bold confrontations with family secrets and breast cancer. The reader will also find sensuous imagery and imaginative metaphors, as in these lines from \\""Living Room Explorers\\"":     Let me slip off my boot of Italy, my sweater    of Zimbabwe and map the dining room table,   the chairs, the matching ocean-colored plates.    We're a number on the earth: latitude wine,   longitude bread and trying   to become our own island.

Granted, I did not find the characters to be as deep or compelling, and there was a brief slow spot in the middle of the story, but for the most part I was glued to this book as firmly as I was to \\""Tears\\"".  In addition, the tone of this story was somewhat lighter, with a lead character who has trouble managing his finances in a world where everything is coin operated, and this may appeal to some more than the dark and gritty style of \\""Tears\\"".I would definitely recommend this - it's a great read!"

But Paloma (\\""Dove\\"" in Spanish) is sad, because she has no one to play with, and she wishes she had a sister.  While a beach bird looks on curiously, she picks up a stick and starts drawing \\""another little girl, like her but with curly hair.\\"" Then the magic begins!  A pile of rocks behind her takes on the shape of a huge boulder-made person (\\""Big Daddy Rock\\"").In a stunning illustration, \\""Daddy\\"" blows and blows until Paloma's drawing turns into a little girl (\\""Sandy\\""), the playmate she wanted!  However, there's a Cinderella time-catch. Big Daddy informs Paloma, \\""You can have your sister til the tide comes back.\\""  Yuyi Morales (a young award-winning artist, as noted above by Amazon) draws shiny-centered yellow swirls of wind against a background of rolls and curves in the now golden sand.  We can feel Amanda White's description of Paloma as \\""amazed and excited and amazed all over again.\\""  The two girls have lots of beach fun, playing in the sand, pretending they're pirates, running after seagulls, and tide-pooling.  Unfathomably, these adventures are not illustrated by the talented Morales.  I would have loved to see her draw pirates and tide pools.  A conflict between the girls and the (temporary) disappearance of Paloma's \\""sister\\"" keep the interest flowing, but the story's initial imagination begins to flounder-especially when compared with Morales' varying perspectives and flair for design.  Even Morales seems constrained by the almost unvarying color schemes and limited settings.  There's a happy conclusion (only slightly related to the magic playmate) that just seems a bit forced and pasted on.The 29 pages show Morales' acrylic brushstrokes, giving them a textured, slightly three-dimensional effect.  Morales also plays with perspective, on pages 1-2, for example, you get a fuller view of the small waves lapping at the sand because she curves the seashore as if viewing it though a small fisheye lens.

I stopped reading \\""V.C. Andrews\\"" novels after the Melody Logan series, which just didn't grab me like the novels that Andrews REALLY wrote.  But, after so many years, I missed the careful web she constructed in Flowers in the Attic, My Sweet Audrina, and Heaven.  So I picked up the Gemini series.  And I felt that there was something there, a true homage to the original author.  It's true that \\""Black Cat\\"" pales in comparison to Andrews' original pen -- she had a style that, no matter how simple or even, dare I say, cheesy, was addictive through and through.  But this book contains a flicker of that original flame, enough to keep you turning the pages.  Overall, I found the storyline of Black Cat to be a little disappointing, and became even more dismayed when I read the excerpt from the next novel in the series, \\""Child of Darkness\\"" (or something like that).  And yet, there is still something there, something that made me spin through the entire book in under two days.  Something that will make me pick up the next book in the series as soon as it hits the shelves.  Celeste, forced to take on her brother Noble's identity and act as big brother to her own secret daughter, is a captivating character.  If nothing else, the storyline is unique.  One bothersome point at the end (without giving anything away):  it says that at that point Celeste is 17 and Baby Celeste is 6.  This can't be right.  We were all there when Baby Celeste was born.  Was Celeste really 11 at that time?    Well, anyway, if you liked Celeste, you will probably like Black Cat, too.  I just wish they would stop talking about the spirits so much.  I could \\""believe\\"" in the rest of the story so much more if they didn't focus on their ancestors from beyond the grave.  And I am hopeful that moreancient secrets will be divulged in the books to come.  What will become of Celeste, Baby Celeste, and Panther?  What about the true first Celeste?  This book contains more questions than answers -- but then, the ghost writer got that part right, for that is the trademark of the second book in an Andrews' series"

With this translation Heaney has done away with said ""official paper"" and we are left with a rousing adventure that taps into our very real notions of heroism.It is not terribly unlikely that since Seamus Heaney is an ""official poet"", his ""official translation"" might turn a few lay readers off before they've even tried reading it.

I was rather under whelmed though with this book by Austrian photographer Peter Granser.  The first thing I noticed was how washed out the color photos looked, as if they are all slightly underexposed, well, maybe that's what the place looks like with the sun shining all year round but the few interior shots also look underexposed.      Of the fifty-four photos in the book sixteen show expanses of exterior bungalow wall, a bit like Lewis Baltz's book 'The New Industrial Parks Near Irvine, California' but Baltz was able to make the mundane look interesting, the Granser wall shots look tedious. Another twenty-three images show retired folk not doing too much, though by the nature of retirement communities there are obviously plenty of activities provided but hardly any are covered and this is the basic problem with the book, it is a European photographer's perspective of a place that is filled with ninety-seven percent white American, reasonably affluent old folk (incidentally, just under a quarter of these retirees have German ancestry).  There are just too few photos in the book that are worth a second look.    There is also a rather rambling photobook essay by Klaus Kleinschidt with the usual impenetrable sentences like:   'The portrait of a person is both: It is profane in that it can be seen every day, and it is sensational in that every person is unique as a phenotype, in rare moments of tension even pointing towards something beyond himself'.  Perhaps having it translated from German didn't help.    There is a photo story to tell about Sun City but unfortunately Peter Granser isn't telling it to me.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover"

Baringer's focus in this book, as suggested by the title, is how Lincoln rose from relative obscurity as a prairie lawyer (and  single-term Congressman) to President of the United States.  Baringer does  a wonderful job showing the importance of public perception, the press, and  Lincoln's speeches, especially during the Lincoln-Douglas debates.  These  debates helped put Lincoln on the national stage.  The one shortcoming of  this book, in my opinion, is that it does not show how Lincoln reached the  prominence in the Illinois Republican Party in the years from 1854 to 1858  to be put in that position of challenging Stephen A. Douglas for the  Senate.

40431721,R13V1F73NIEOU4,1578512530,794424477,Judo Strategy: Turning Your Competitors' Strength to Your Advantage,Books,5.0,5.0,6.0,Highly recommended,"I read dozens of business books every year, and this one is a standout.  In clear compelling language, Yoffie and Kwak lay out a set of strategic principles and techniques that companies can use to fight back against stronger competitors.  The three principles they analyze are movement, balance, and leverage; the techniques include the puppy dog ploy, define the competitive space, and leverage your opponent's assets, partners, and competitors. These ideas come originally from the sport of judo, but Yoffie and Kwak demonstrate through numerous examples that they also make sense in business.As well as short examples from Intuit, eBay, Schwab, etc. that are used to explain the three principles, the book includes indepth studies of three companies that have been successful at judo strategy (Palm, Real Networks, and CNET).  These chapters are a ""must read"" for anyone interested in the new economy.  A great deal has been written about all three companies (especially Palm), but here the analysis and details, often culled from interviews, are first-rate.The last section of the book deals with sumo strategy, which is the counterpart to judo for large companies such as Microsoft and Intel.  Smaller companies will find few direct lessons here, but reading about sumo strategy is a good wake-up call for anyone who thought that competing with giants might be easy"

I am not a fan of multiple formula novels churned out by lazy writers, and I was suspicious of this series.But Cornwell has done something different here.  He has taken real events, from the career of Arthur Wellesley (later the Duke of Wellington).  Then he has inserted the character of Richard Sharp, a canny ex-thief ranker in the British Infantry.  One of the men Wellington was to describe as ""Scum of the Earth"" after Badajoz.  From the viewpoint of Sharpe we see the business end of the British Army, a worms eye view of the rise of Wellesley and the Indian and Peninsular campaigns.What you are getting is real history fleshed out with a cracking good story.  And it is very well done!  I am very tempted to dig further into this substantial series of books.  I can see why they have become so popular"
51741466,R135G8JVHUMJR0,155817379X,201185282,Georgina,Books,4.0,3.0,3.0,Unusual Hero,"By the time she wrote Georgina, Ms Darcy seemed to have a firmer understanding of narrative structure.  She was slipping more information into the intereaction of the characters rather than long paragraphs of exposition.This novel had an unusual hero for it's time (or indeed since).  He is the illegitimate son of an Earl, who had been raised with the Earl's own children and given the task of running the Earl's estates.  After his father died he did not get along with the new heir so he was set on finding a new post.  Instead he chanced to meet an Irish heiress, marry her and go journeying on the continent.When the novel opens, the heiress is dead (within a year of their marriage) and her estate has passed to the widower's hands adding the reputation of fortune hunter to his own significant social disabilities.  He is expected at any moment to arrive and claim his estate.  Meanwhile the relation who had been in charge of the estate in the absense of its owners, has let things get very much out of hand.  The Bailiff has the accounts in a muddle, the Butler has been in the Madeira and Arabella, who should have removed herself and her son months ago, has complicated the matter by inviting a young cousin, who was by way of being an heiress herself, to visit in the hopes that she would make a match with her son Brandon.Georgina, who was sent to Ireland in disgrace because she would not marry a suitor approved by her tartar of a grandmother, is a headstrong miss with decided ideas about honor and family feeling.  She is quite determined to support her cousins against this interloper.  But when the interloper does appear to have some finer qualities she finds herself championing him against the prejudices of the neighborhood worthies instead.Unfortunately the heroine is 18 and her social sense is not yet developed.  Her attempts at bringing Mr. Shannon into the County society are more well meaning than successful.This book still bears reading.  The Regency era is more than wallpaper to the story.  The characters are interesting.  And if I spent a certain amount of time wanting to shake Georgina, it has to do with the 30 years that have passed since I last read this book, rather than any lack of skill on the author's part.  I have the same reaction to most of my friends' children at that age.g.  The Regency era is more than wallpaper to the story.  The characters are interesting.

Imagine a highly evolved human being who has dedicated her entire adult life to what it means to be an evolved human being.  Imagine investing thousands of hours, countless hours, studying and practicing psychology, sociology, philosophy, cognition, transactional analysis, gestalt therapy, neurolinguistic programming, eastern spirituality, therapy and coaching.Now imagine this person recently finished elegantly capturing the most powerful insights from this life dedicated to action research in these areas.This is obviously someone whose life's work is to heal the planet.Finally, imagine visiting with this Goddess, one on one, and engaging in an exchange where these insights are transfused into your consciousness instantly, easily and effortlessly.Susan's insights are so powerful, simply reading this book is life altering.  It is impossible to not be automatically evolved simply by being exposed to the truth skills Susan shares, such as noticing whether your intent is to relate or control, or attachment to being right, or being able to hold different viewpoints simultaneously.  It isn't just the skills Susan shares that make a difference, though that would be powerful in itself.  It is the heartfelt way she shares them, and the examples and exercises she shares, that really make these profound yet simple ideas come to life for the reader.Even more powerfully dramatic, however, is the transformation the reader experiences as one begins to apply the skills and the philosophy to interactions with others.  The reader's filters and lenses are forever adjusted, enhanced, expanded, tuned up and refined, resulting in a new experience of life, understanding more fully what is meant by ""being present in the moment"".So often we are run by our stories, our interpretations, our beliefs, our assumptions and our habits.  Susan shares in language that is easy to understand and apply, how we can take being human to a more evolved place.I strongly recommend this book as mandatory reading for anyone who is passionately committed to living an authentic life"

Mr. McCumber has an engaging style that avoids ""gee-whiz"" or ""slumming in the country"" overtones. He  captures vividly the tiring, dirty and often dangerous labor and financial  risk involved in ranching today.Much of the American cowboy-hero myth  has been fed by the ignorance of us Easterners, comfortably removed from  the drudgery and rawness of the West. Yet the cowboy-hero stands on a  ""code"" of solid, and very real, virtues: fortitude and competence  in your work, being good for your word, and ""backing your partner's  play."" Today's real cowboys judge one another by those values; those  who last in a ranch crew live by them. Their reality may not be for most of  us, yet we can respect and profit from its example"

The book used in my class is \\""Literacy ,Technology, and Society; Confronting the Issues\\"" by Gail E. Hawisher and Cynthia L. Selfe. It teaches readers to read critically, proves how important organization truly is, and uses different types of language and word choices to show how it affects the writing style.      The content of this book helps to teach significant critical reading. Literacy, Society, and Technology (L.T.S.) has all types of writing from the most fine tuned author to an everyday news article. There are articles that have ridiculously advanced vocabulary but the organization is absolutely brutal. This is perfect to teach students how to read article critically.  So there vocabulary is pretty large but if none of it makes sense is the article believable? Absolutely not, how do you know that this is not just some person that bought a dictionary and is toying around with writing. There are other examples of articles that are written at a sixth grade level, but with good organization and the strong points they make, in some cases unforgettable points that will stick with you through the entire article. Now don't get me wrong there are some very well written articles from some highly noted authors. The bill of rights is noted and referred to as an example of critical reading and most of these articles directly relate to it. Reading these articles is a  great way to teach students to break down articles and really dig deep into what they are saying and at times implying. Its amazing the difference between just reading an article and reading an article critically. Like everything, this book does have some down falls. This book is not an ordinary educational textbook that most classes require. Most books have chapter tests and lots of questions for the students to answer that relate to the articles but this book just barely grazes that issue. It has some questions, like four at the end of each article, but they are all really weak and have nothing to do with critical reading or organization. They ask you to write questions the had to do with the article and other high school oriented questions. The articles have to be looked at in a critical way and that is up to the professor. In my case the professor creates questions purely about critical thinking. And we have discussions about reading the article critically and weak points that we found. There are no chapters test or anything even close to that in this book. There aren't even chapters, its just a bunch of articles that are pieced together perfectly. Another down fall of this book is that it is fairly out dated. Some of the text in this book is from the early nineteen nineties and even date back to the late eighties. In most cases this would be a big deal except for one, technology which isthe main topic of this book. The book deals with internet costs and security issues on the internet that have been dealt with and overcome. It doesn't take away from any educational purposes. There were some points that were harder to relate to because of this time gap. It talks about the internet costing about $100 and in today's economy it is possible to get it for free in some cases. That kind of makes these articles seem like they are much more out of date then they truly are. This book is all about organization. That is what it teaches and is why it is so effective in learning. Every article in L.T.S. is showing different examples oforganization. Teaching the difference between smooth writing and real choppy texts. There aren't any questions, it teaches completely by examples. When reading these articles it teaches the difference between choppy and smooth writing and helps you to learn from the example and create a smooth flow for your own papers.   The best thing about this book is how it proves that vocabulary does not make a paper. Language is thekey to writing. Through it's text it proves that word choice is the biggest factor in writing. Sure if you has a large vocabulary you can use it, but that is not the only thing to looks at. Word choice helps to prove your points, and pulls your reader into the article; that is \\""style.\\""  Pathos and Ethos are created by word choice. This book reinforces that. It shows that a paper written at a six grade level can actually be more appealing and draw the reader in more than some person using words that can not even be interpreted by the read.  This book stress the importance of writing at the level of the expected reader. This is a great book  for the everyday college writer. It gives good examples of critical reading, importance of organization, and how language and word choice affects the style of writing. It caters to issues that plague students in there writing and makes writing problems more apparent. The examples assist the college students to recognize the problem and develop ways to work through them. I recommend this book to students developing their writing skills at the college level. It has helped me organize my writing and become more aware of my word choices"

I am very big on recycling so I held off until recently when I read different product reviews concerning various refillable k-cups. It was not until I read rave reviews (thank you!) about the Ekobrew refillable cup, that I seriously considered purchasing a Keurig coffee maker. Based on several reviews, I just recently purchased the B60 Special Edition Keurig model coffee maker as well as ordered an Ekobrew refillable cup since it is compatible with this model. So PLEASE, make sure your Keurig is compatible with the Ekobrew cup prior to purchase. I just received both items yesterday and thanks to all the wonderfully descriptive reviews, I knew what to expect and how to fill the cup with my own coffee. The first couple of cups were questionable in strength but once I got the hang of it, the coffee strength was to my liking. And since I like my coffee medium strength and I use a 16 ounce travel mug to keep the coffee hot, (even when removing the assembly housing, my mug is too tall), I use a glass measuring cup, then select the 8 oz cup choice, let that run it's course, then select it again (after opening and closing the Keurig lid to reset it. I then pour the coffee into my mug. It's perfect strength for me.  And most importantly, for the purpose of this review, the Ekobrew cup fits well in this Keurig model. I have absolutely no issues with it at all. No fussing with it to get it to fit. It's perfect. The Keurig came with 10 k-cup samples of which I opened one to compare the grind and amount of coffee to what I would need for the Ekobrew cup.  Other than that, I will just save the k-cups for guests. I prefer my own coffee brands and I like to mix different flavors.  Just a moment ago, I mixed a medium roast with a creme brulee flavored coffee and it is amazing.  And as far as clean up, it is simple. Since I don't like to put food down the drain if I can help it, I simply tap the majority of the grounds in the trash then rinse it with cold water. It only takes about 15 seconds! It really is not that inconvenient. In my opinion, it's much better than wasted k-cups at the landfill.  Thank you Ekobrew! This product was worth the purchase and then some"

This is Java tea. The 12 ounce bottles are made of breakable glass, and would be better in PET plastic bottles. The Amazon product description, and the Tejava web site, also list it as a black tea. It is nice to find bottled tea without flavorings, preservatives, sugar, fructose, or artificial sweeteners. This is great for people like me who are pre-diabetic, and have to avoid sugar. This tea is very strong, and would be best served over ice to thin it out a bit. The amount of acidity could cause a stomach ache in anyone prone to acid stomach problems. (It happened to me.

I gave this tea four stars for the tea and the fact that it was sold in breakable glass bottles. The tejava.com website said:\\""The North American Tea Championship is an independent event, judged by professional cuppers, to distinguish the highest quality and best tasting teas from around the world that are available in the North American marketplace. The annual Championship is made up of two classes: Hot Tea and Iced Tea. The Iced Tea Class was evaluated in May. Nearly 250 premium iced teas were entered into this year's Iced Tea class, which featured 20 categories. Each submission is evaluated through blind organoleptic analysis of the following characteristics: flavor, mouthfeel, color, clarity, and balance. An overall numerical value is then calculated based on the ratings of each characteristic above, and winners are determined by rank.The Tejava Difference.Tejava is the world's only 100% all natural, microbrewed and ready-to-drink iced tea made entirely from select, handpicked tea leaves from the island of Java.

These are simply the premier canned tomato. I prefer the whole tomatoes for cooking because I like to tear mine into rags rather than have diced ones. The special thing about these is that they are a specific breed of tomato that has far fewer seeds so you don't have to use care when adding them to chili or sauces. With other types, I have to tear them over a sieve to keep the seeds out. I buy them by the case - far better price - to ensure I always have them for any impromptu cookery"

Okay, so I wanted to start my review on a positive note...The flavor is mildly herb-y, and salt predominates.  Certainly, I cannot taste any Parmesan cheese.The product page suggests that this product works with chicken pieces or pork.  I'm here to say that you should be aware that whatever goes into this \\""roasting\\"" bag will be steamed and eventually boiled, and definitely not roasted and not caramelized.  So choose your cut of chicken or pork carefully, while keeping that in mind. And remove every morsel of fat before it goes in the bag.In other words, if you use skin-on chicken pieces you might just be turned off chicken skin for life.  Seriously...And maybe that is a plus--at least for me.  For a long time, I've been trying to convince myself that I don't need to eat that beautifully browned and juicy and crisp chicken skin from my roasted chicken.  Now, after eating one of the chicken thighs steamed in this bag, I won't be eating chicken again for a while, and I will think twice, maybe three times, before I eat the skin--no matter how crispy it is.Maybe boneless, skinless breast meat is the only viable alternative in this case. And that might be fine for you.  Add a few sprigs of rosemary and maybe a few chopped veggies, then de-fat the juice and sprinkle on some real Parmesan when the chicken gets to the serving platter and you might just have something your family will love.  Or maybe dab some Dijon mustard on the chicken before it goes in the bag.  This product does need \\""help\\"" to taste good.It cleans up nicely.  And it's a quick meal, but then chicken breasts always are.I'll never give this product another chance.  Give me a whole chicken, let me dust it with fine sea salt and toss it on the gas grill over indirect heat.  My chicken--and my meal--will be perfect and I'll be serving within an hour"

Deep fry these to golden brown and either sit them in a bowl beside and let people add them to their own bowl or stir them in right before you serve.VERY OPTIONAL: Old Bay or Cajun seasoning to taste.If you want to make Death Pies just cut out the potatoes, double the meat, and bake in a flaky pie crust.

When used this way there is virtually no aftertaste.  I like that it is pure with no additives.

I wish I'd read the reviews more closely and perhaps tried the Bassett's. If you like sweet candy? You may enjoy these and for the price; I suppose it's a kind of bargain. They aren't flavors you'd assume they'd be; perhaps? Purple is not grape - it almost has a basil flavor to it. The texture and all is very strange as well. It took me several of these to try and suss out how I'd compare it to American candies so that you can maybe glean some idea if you're familiar with US candies. I expected something like a gummy bear but with a powdered sugar or cornstarch sort of coating. This is definitely coated in what seems to be corn starch but the texture is odd. It's like a circus peanut kind of outside with this more jelly like candy core. Chewy. Fruity and almost hurt your teeth sweet.I wanted to like them. I like all kinds of confections and candy. These were just a little too strange in flavor and texture for me to manage to take a liking to them. One reviewer questioned if they were stale perhaps - I assume due to that two texture thing this candy has going on. They seem quite fresh though - so I think this is simply how the jelly babies are. I may update this review if I order other Jelly Babies to compare textures and flavors, etc. Hopefully this review along with the others help you decide on your purchase. I guess these are a cheaper substitute Jelly Baby-like candy; but not the UK 'real deal'"

(Supposedly, the shark is in homage to the shark-infested waters off the coast of Sriracha). Shark brand is made in Thailand and is used widely there as well as imported to U.S. stores and restaurants. Huy Fong is made in California by a Vietnamese immigrant, David Tran, and is the U.S. favorite.]]Sriracha is made of sun ripened chilies that are ground into a smooth paste with garlic. The sauce is nearly as thick as ketchup, which makes the squeeze bottle a handy way to deliver a spicy kick to your favorite foods. Speaking of ketchup, a little sriracha can add a nice kick to ketchup or your favorite dipping sauce without overpowering the other ingredients.Newman's story featured recipes were adapted from Greg Gilbert, Jackson & Wheeler.Sriracha Remoulade1 cup mayonnaise1/4 cup sriracha2 tablespoons red wine vinegarWhisk together until smooth.

If you don't like the taste of seaweed snacks, you should stay away from these, because that taste is definitely present (even though these are more cracker-like than traditional seaweed snacks). However, if you like seaweed snacks, these have that same flavor with a bit of added kick from chili powder (you do get a little on your hands but it's not bad).These are fairly salty (190 mg per serving) but that's generally to be expected with seaweed products. As long as you're not eating 4 or 5 bags at a time, you'll probably be fine (although you may want to avoid them if you are watching your sodium intake). They have a nice crunch and they're pretty low in fat (they're baked) so your fingers don't get all oily when you eat them.If you have dietary restrictions, these are gluten free and vegan and they also are free of MSG. These do have soy-based ingredients, though. Also, please note that you may want a mint or gum handy afterwards, because these have garlic and onion powder and those flavors may linger for awhile after you eat these. (For what it's worth, the bag is compostable.)Seaweed snacks are growing on me so I liked these. Definitely worth a try if you like spicy things and Asian flavors"

I like Mexican chorizo a lot, but I love this stuff much better.It melts in your mouth and transports you to the land of the delicatessen.

Found this STUBBS brand here on Amazon. It has no HFCS. We tried the original flavor and love it. In addition to its delicious taste, there is no high fructose corn syrup. We try to eat healthy and eat a lot of ground turkey. We found the barbeque jazzes up the poultry flavor and makes a tasty sloppy joe. You can add onions and green pepper bits for added taste. It makes a delicious pulled pork sandwich and tasty on ham, too.We wished to try some of STUBBS other BarBQ sauces so are sampling this Hickory Bourbon flavor. It has a deeper flavor with a hickory smoke undertone. Not as tangy as the original flavor. I like both. I haven't tried Bourbon, and don't drink, but couldn't detect any alcohol flavor. Just a nice deep smoky flavor. It isn't high in sugar with 7g for two tablespoons. A nutritionist recommended that you stay under 8g when eating cereal. A cup of milk has 12g of sugar, so if you put a couple of tablespoons of this sauce on a pork sandwich, turkey burger, or hamburger, there is less sugar in it than drinking a cup of milk.Ingredients in this Hickory Smoke BBQ include:Water, sugar, tomato paste, molasses, distilled vinegar, bourbon, salt, corn starch, spices, contains less than 0.5% of: onion, garlic, natural hickory smoke flavor, caramel color, corn syrup, tamarind, natual flavors, xanthan gum, guar gum.If you like a smoky BBQ with a hint of Bourbon, you may want to sample this STUBBS Hickory Bourbon flavor.

And no, it isn't cheap.However, for me at least, it's been so very helpful.  I've been on a low-carb diet for 5.5 years and after about 2 years I began experiencing pain in my right kidney.  I went to doctors multiple times and they all said my kidney function was completely normal.  This salt quite literally cured this painful condition for me.I don't know if it's specifically caused by the low-carb diet or more likely a combination of the low-carb diet (which may eliminate minerals we would typically get in processed foods), a lot of tea drinking, and the fact that at work I only have access to reverse osmosis water (which has the minerals removed).  Whatever may have caused it - the DAY AFTER I started using this type of salt my kidney pain was gone completely.  I was not expecting it to cure this, I started using the salt because of the minerals in it but had no clue that was what was causing my kidney pain.  In the several months since then the only time my kidney pain recurs I can always look back at the previous couple of days and see that I have not had my usual amount of this salt.If you have troublesome kidney pain that seems to have no other cause I would definitely try using a grey salt like this one.On a side note, I've had low blood-pressure for years and I've added about 1.5 teaspoons of this salt to my diet per day (besides what I was already ingesting in food). I experienced a VERY slight increase in my blood pressure, most likely \\""caused\\"" by the salt.  By slight I mean a couple of points.

I bought two boxes for my mother. For $10 a package it was an excellent price. I understand these were returns to Amazon but it didn't look like it. It was in brand new unopened condition. I normally would give 5 stars except for one thing. The \\""best by\\"" date listed July 30, 2012. I got it May 31, 2012. If it was 6 months I probably wouldn't worry but two months is a problem. So I dropped it to 3 stars. The price and the fact I still have two months saves it. I guess I will have to help my mom finish these off. Luckily they are pretty good. I may buy again from the seller since the price is good. Wish the \\""best by\\"" could have been listed before I ordered.UPDATE (July 13, 2012) Bought again through Amazon but from  another seller, ezee llc (lindasproperties), for $17.10 per 24 pack. That was way more than my original order but my mom wanted more. Seeing it was close to the MSRP of $19.99, I was expecting to receive a product that had a better \\""best by\\"" date. No, this time it was worse. The \\""best by\\"" date is August 17, 2012. I have little over a month to go. Granted my mom will probably finish it within that time frame but this is unacceptable. I'm dropping the product rating to two stars due to unsatisfactory experiences with two different sellers. I should get at lest six months.UPDATE (October 24, 2012) I guess my mom goes through this quite quickly. I purchased through a seller on eBay for $17.95 per 24 pack on September 10, 2012. This time around I got a package that was well more than a year out for the \\""best by\\"" date. So I guess I know now that this product actually has a good shelf life if purchased from a proper seller. I realize my star rating is harsh since it focuses on the seller not the product. The taste and flavor is excellent and I have definitely purchased and drank this multiple times when I am at my parents. I am going to bump the review to 5 out of 5 because the product itself is not at fault. Just buy it from a good seller"

Morning Pep's Organic Coconut Sugar seems like an obvious alternative to refined/processed cane sugar AND artificial sweeteners.  AND with a low glycemic index it is a perfect sweetener to satisfy cravings and prevent that ""sugar-crash"" associated with high carbohydrate snacks.My experiences so far have been excellent.  On hot cereal, it adds a hearty richness.  In a morning smoothie, it dissolves quickly(even with the addition of frozen fruit and cold almond milk).  Though I have not tried baking with it yet, I have no reason to have concerns. I did however make the best no-bake cookies I have ever had!  Using the traditional recipe and gluten-free oats, I put the Organic Coconut Sugar to the test- cup for cup! Having the cookies set without crystallizing was really my only worry, and this sugar yielded excellent results without modifying the recipe. I wish I could say that the flavor was the same, but it WAS BETTER. (I should note that I also used Morning Pep's Raw Organic Dark Cocoa Powder.)Morning Pep has shown dedication to offering FIVE STAR Products, and the Organic Coconut Palm Sugar is certainly one of them!

I found out he had a 103 fever. I gave him tylenol, he was so lethargic. He couldn't even walk, I had to carry him to the car and then inside. I put him to bed at 5pm, and checked on him a little while later, his hair was stuck to his head and pillow was soaked from sweat. I ran and got him another dose of tylenol, and then realized I had this product in my cabinet. I went ahead and gave him this as well. I was so scared, I brought him to Urgent Care. By the time we checked in and were seen by a doctor, he was like a whole new kid. He was up and alert and acting totally normal and his temp was 98. I was actually embarrassed to be at urgent care. The doctors said he had a virus and prescribed him more tylenol and motrin.The next day he seemed fine, but that night I heard him moaning, and ran upstairs and he was sweating and jerking. I ran downstairs and got him more tylenol, and decided to give him another dose of hylands. I came upstairs,and he started jerking again, like having a seizure. I took him to the er, and once again, his fever was down (maybe due to tylenol) and he was acting alert and not sick at all. The doctor didn't think it was a seizure and sent us on our way (after 5 hours of course.)My conclusion, this stuff really works to get rid of symptoms. My son was just so lethargic and like a ragdoll-the first day, very miserable. This medicine didn't get rid of his virus, but it miraculously got rid of his symptoms, whereas tylenol alone didn't work. My husband called it a miracle.

50027179,RQ7Z860IO0V3U,B00CWHX88K,440123242,Cherrywood Smoked Sea Salt,Grocery,5.0,0.0,0.0,Good,"This cherry smoked salt is much more subtle than I was expecting. After tasting San Francisco Salt's campfire in a bag alder wood smoked salt, I expected this to have a strong smoke flavor, (Alderwood Smoked Sea Salt (5oz Pouch Fine Grain)). Instead this works quietly and simply with food.I love fruitwood smoke; there is the campfire smell, but then a hint of the fruit, apple or cherry. Fruit wood chips work really well with pork, but not beef or fish. The same holds true for this salt, it is perfect for a pork chop or ham; but is not the best with fish, hamburgers, or steak.San Francisco Salt did an excellent job with making this salt and packaging it. There is no artificial smoke. The salt looks a lot like pepper, there are small granules of black that look like ash or bits of charcoal (the bits are so small there is no crunch to them at all). I love the packaging; they have found the nearly perfect plastic barrier pouch. There is no smoke smell when the bag is closed. This means all the flavor and smoke odor stay with the salt and don't migrate out over time. I also like the standup seal in the bottom of the pouch - this is like the football seal on the bottom of Capri Sun pouches.The barrier packaging is incredibly important. A glass jar with a cork top will eventually allow the smoke flavor to dissipate through the cork, not so with this pouch. San Francisco Salt will remain fresher longer than the glass / cork jars by Artisan Salt.It might be smart to transfer the salt to a glass jar with a tight fitting lid. I find it hard to reclose the zipper every time, especially if I shake salt out of the bag. Really fine dust gets in the zipper and keeps it from sealing perfectly.This is a good product. I like the alder wood smoked salt much better, I love campfires. If you are looking for a subtle slight smoke flavor addition, this is a good choice.I was provided a sample for review"

It also has a bitter undertaste as one might expect from milled hempseed.It does not mix well with liquids; the insoluble seed husks tend to settle. On the other hand, it mixes very well with hot cereal, cornbread and other quickbreads like banana bread. You can keep it in suspension in a hot drink like coffee or hot chocolate as long as you stir each time before drinking.It takes a lot of the powder to provide a full day's fiber, something like 3 tablespoons. It is easier to take in smaller amounts. Taking a few teaspoons with breakfast can help an otherwise healthy diet add more fiber and protein without adding fat.The protein and fiber is from an excellent vegetable source.Overall, I will continue to use it and I would recommend it to others. If it were more finely milled and had no undertaste it would get five stars, but it is still an excellent product"

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.Almonds are a good source of Fiber.One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?Two things:1st be cautious about \\""bowel tolerance\\"" or \\""happy bowels\\"" if you prefer.2nd Taste.

I love my Keurig, but have always felt guilty about throwing away those plastic cups. Not only was this purchase about half the price of store-bought K cups, these pods are mostly biodegradable.  (There is a plastic ring around the top to fit into the Keurig properly) Even the box they come in is made from recylced material and the ink used on the box comes from renewable resources.  The grounds can easily be composted. The box says that the Rogers Family has been in the coffee business since 1979.  They should know good tasing coffee. The taste sure hits the mark for our household.  We like medium to bold flavor and have been enjoying Millstone Foglifter, Folger's gourmet (Lively Columbian) and Newman's Special Blend for years.  I am thrilled to find a taste that's so comparable but costs half per cup.  The box comes with pouches containing 6 pods per pouch to sustain freshness.  Once I open a pouch I put the remaining pods in the refrigerator to keep them as fresh as possible.  Taste great, better for the environment, less expensive, works in Keurig....hits all the marks!

52989182,R1QQO5ANLDPG9M,B00016AU3K,804798004,Yogi Tea Co. - Kava Stress Relief - 16 teabags,Grocery,4.0,3.0,5.0,"Delicious, Yes, May Help With Stress Relief","This Kava Stress Relief Tea from Yogi Tea is for anxiety relief. It's an unusual tea, slightly sweet (it contains stevia) and very carob-y. The good news is that it does not have any of the usual kava taste or smell that many people find offensive. The bad news is that I can't feel any of the anxiety relief effects of the tea, although it does say that there are 78mg of kava root extract in the tea. Still, it's a lovely cup of tea, and relaxing because it just tastes good. I can also taste the spiciness of the tea, which is very pleasant. I usually brew two bags in one cup, which is recommended on the package for a stronger and more relaxing effect; however, I even tried four bags once, but still didn't notice a relaxing effect. I am familiar with kava and the overall effect of kava is pretty subtle anyway, so this is something to be aware of. Your experience of the tea may be different.Kava Stress Relief Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh) and has many organic ingredients.The ingredients in Kava Stress Relief Tea are: kava root extract, carob pod, Indian sarsaparilla root, organic cinnamon bark, organic ginger root, organic cardamom seed, stevia leaf, barley malt, natural hazelnut flavor, natural cinnamon flavor, and natural licorice flavor. Amazingly, I can taste many of these in this lovely and complex cup of tea. I would rate the taste five stars for flavor and uniqueness.Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make. Their tea bag tags have metaphysical sayings on them like, \\""Your breath is the voice of your soul\\"" and \\""Your head must bow to your heart\\"".Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: \\""Kava Stress Relief tea helps you calm down as it relieves stress, anxiety and minor pain, as well as lending gentle support to the digestion and the kidneys. A member of the peppercorn family, Kava (Piper methysticum) is a highly prized medicinal and beverage plant, whose primary benefit is alleviating anxiety. \\""Kava-kava,\\"" native to Oceania and the South Pacific Islands, has been used and cultivated for its ability to calm the body and mind, and encourage a good night's sleep. A powerful antispasmodic, this herb promotes a state of \\""relaxed unconcern\\"" while compromising neither mental functions nor clarity of thought when used appropriately. Furthermore, Kava has been shown to relax the uterus and relieve menstrual cramps and minor menopausal symptoms.* The Herb Research Foundation (2000) indicates that scientific data supports the use of kava for minor anxiety, stress, restlessness, muscle tension and mild pain. For added flavor, our formula has been complemented with Stevia, Sarsaparilla and Organic Carob. Enjoy a warm soothing cup of Kava Stress Relief, a delicious way to relax.\\""In addition to the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease, there is a warning on the box, \\""Ask a healthcare professional before use if you have or have had liver problems, frequently use alcoholic beverages, or are taking any medication. Stop use and see a doctor if you develop symptoms that may signal liver problems (e.g., unexplained fatigue, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, fever, vomiting, dark urine, pale stools, yellow eyes or skin). Not for use by persons under 18 years of age, or by pregnant or breastfeeding women. Not for use with alcoholic beverages. Excessive use, or use with products that cause drowsiness, may impair your ability to operate a vehicle or heavy equipment.\\""Note that the media scare about kava several years ago was not for the kava root, and it is my opinion that based on my own research that kava is very safe. However, I am not a physician, and if you have any health concerns, you should check with an appropriate professional.I decided to give Kava Stress Relief Tea four stars since it didn't really work for me. Still, it is a wonderful and recommended tea, and may work for you!****own research that kava is very safe.

I'd done that with a different brand/vendor previously and the product did not stand up to shipping with one batch too hard and another one 'turned'.This time the mochi arrived still soft and fresh enough to eat. That said, I'm sure there are some extra chemicals/food additives to make that so and I get a hint of a different flavor.

I haven't found any garbage pieces or stems in the cans yet and the corn seems to be of high quality.

There is very little to grab the interior of the pocket and the whole holster tends to come out with the draw. The outer panel itself is vinyl, not leather.- After a relatively short period of time, I noticed that the outer panel was beginning to conform to the shape of the handgun and it began to print.- The foam piece that creates retention and is removed to accommodate a laser also tends to grab the frame of the handgun. Even on its loosest setting it still holds onto the handgun a bit. Even though the leather is broken in, the foam has not. Combined with the slick exterior of the holster, it seems to increase the chances of drawing the entire holster out"

You will end up twisting your waist all the way to the side and using your weak hand to open it up to get the trigger guard back in.

Ever since I signed up for Amazon Prime,  I almost get angry when something is not eligible.  I've grown to hate waiting more than 2 days.  Then when I click on an item that isn't eligible and it also says \\""this item takes an additional 3-5 days through this vendor\\"" well,  I nearly lose it.  I'm proud to report that UAG is actually faster than some of the Prime items I've ordered and the packaging was great!  As for the product,  everything is extremely solid and durable.  Fit and finish was amazing,  the seems from butt stock to receiver were actually tighter than the wood stock that came attached from Mossberg.    I ordered this not realizing the laser was part of the package.  Had it not been, this would be 5 stars.  But it was, and now I have to review it. The laser is literally a throwaway,  it is not accurate, comes with bad batteries and the pressure switch is an uncomfortable afterthought.  It does not even come packed in the same box as the kit.    The flashlight looks like a Surefire knockoff, but is heavy, well built and super bright.

Do not buy.The full story:Attempt #1: Somehow, UPS managed to lose a bulky 75lb package in the mail. The tracking information never got updated after it supposedly left the facility. Neither UPS nor Amazon has a clue what happened.Attempt #2: Replacement sent from Amazon with free one-day delivery; got here the next day. The front foot bar was bent and did not fit in properly. The low quality nut and bolt just sort of disintegrated and the nut just spun around and around without tightening enough. I was so annoyed by the whole process at this point I just went to a hardware store and bought some bigger stronger nuts and bolts and manged to get it on securely. After one week of light use, maybe 10 to 15 minutes a day with mid-range resistance set and a mild pace, it began to squeak 10 minutes into use. After another 2, there was a noise and all resistance was gone. Completely dead. Something fell apart inside, so Amazon decided to send out a new one.Attempt #3: Replacement sent from Amazon with free one-day delivery... but got here in three days. I don't really like UPS anymore. This time I had already deciphered the atrocious instructions and put it together rather quickly in comparison. The handlebars were noticeably crooked on this one, however, it was simple enough to just swap the junk parts from this one for the good parts from the broken one as I was sending the return out the next day. Two days later I sat down on the thing, put it on a good mid-range resistance, and set out to go 15 minutes at a relatively slow pace. TWELVE AND A HALF MINUTES. After 12:30 there was a noise and something came off inside and now it doesn't work at all. I had a hard time even attempting to get inside the preassembled main drive, and ended up just demanding a refund for this thing. It won't evenlast 15 minutes before dying.So, conclusion: This product is of so low build quality that I would consider it a scam. On the plus side, Amazon customer service has been good"

The quality is fair and I fear it won't hold up to 3 kids under 10 using it for very long. Time will tell.  When putting it together it was missing several bolts which I had to go to the hardware store to replace. It also arrived damaged with a hole in the side of the box resulting in a hole through the ping pong table top.  That led me to attempt to call customer service. I had left four messages requesting a return call to no avail. Finally, I spoke to someone live and when questioning why no one has called me back, I was told they had over 3000 messages after returning from the holidays. That alone says something about the prodcut quality!! I did not have the model number of my table, but did have the shipping info and the order number and was still told I need to call back with the model number. No effort was made to help identify the model number even with the description, shipping and order info. That is Customer Service?

This feels more natural in the hand than any other knife I own - the handle/hilt design is exceptional.  As far as the blade goes, it came so sharp I didn't feel the need to put a finer edge on it (though an enthusiast might want to.)  The knife's well-balanced and has a good weight to it.  I would easily pay twice what I paid for this.The leather sheath that comes with this knife surprised me - like other reviewers stated, it's of higher quality than you'd expect from a $20 knife.  Definitely not that thin, plastic-y pseudo-leather you sometimes get with cheaper knives.  The snap holds the knife snugly in place, and snaps off easily with one hand.  There's a slight give to the belt loop so you can rotate the knife slightly to wear at a small angle if you so choose, which is a cool feature.There's a reason this knife is among the highest-rated and best-selling knives on Amazon.  I did a lot of online research and read a ton of reviews on multiple knives before buying this one, and I couldn't be happier.  I'll probably end up buying more as gifts for family members - one of the best Amazon purchases I've made"

At the time of purchase","I'm an avid collector of flashlights and always had an eye on the TN31, so when I saw it on Prime for $99, I had to pull the trigger.  I have always preferred ""throwers"" over ""flooders"" so I'm always looking for the next great thrower.  At the time of purchase,  my three best throwing lights were: Yezl y3,  Jacob A60 and Maxtoch 2XS with the Maxtoch being king.  The TN31's hotspot is roughly 1/3 smaller than the Maxtochs and noticeably brighter- the smaller hotspot will sit inside the larger one and outshine it like a brighter bullseye.  For large size of the light,  the hotspot is tiny- a dedome must make a laser like beam profile (a fairly simple modification if you are familiar with these things) and the stock throw is pure muscle,  very impressive.  Build quality is excellent,  solid individual clicks for each mode while you cycle through with the magnetic ring.  A usable low setting and nicely spaced modes from there on up.  Well packaged and comes with holster,  spare o-rings,  spare switch and an adjustable lanyard.  Only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that 5 is the highest you can go with no room for improvement. This light is exceptional and well worth the price but had it come without the threads glued together,  dedomed from the factory like some of the new O-Lights and maybe packed in a nice, collectable hard case instead of a cardboard box,  it would have earned 5 stars"

But I have gone paintballing with this vest but not airsofting but they are both the same thing almost. As for comfort I am going to have to give it a 8 out of 10 because sometimes when you are running really fast to avoid getting hit the vest kind of comes a little bit up but that's not a show stopper for me. I wear soft armor inserts in mine because they are light weight and they will stop mainly what you will face in street battle and that's pistol rounds. The vest will basically hold any type of armor because they give you a lot of room to work with. Another thing I like is the MOLLE webbing, they give you MOLLE webbing all over the vest and I currently am running two quad M4 magazine pouches and dump pouch and flashlight and multi-tool pouch. They also give you a heavy duty drag handle so you can pull your buddy into cover if he is hit and they Velcro it down so it does not snag. They also give you two strips of Velcro on the first two rows in the front and in the back. I use them for a nametape in the front and the back and I also put my rank on the front. The stitching on it is pretty good I have only a couple rips in the vest but I thing that was when I was placing my Gerber profile in its sheath and the blade caught a bit of the stitching. The material the use is Nylon Denier Cordura which is a very strong material that even has a bit of fire proofness to it. The shipping was fast and I totally recommend this to anyone that is looking for a good tactical vest that they could use if the SHTF or any other type of situation. Thanks for reading.SFCGrazier"

We did not pay for installation services, and our gym room is on the third floor of our house.  We ended up renting a high capacity appliance dolly from a moving company to get the thing upstairs.  It is HEAVY.  It took two of us a half hour going one step at a time to get the deck upstairs, but finally we made it.  The color touch screen is cool, but many of the features require an iFit account to be able to use them.  I signed up for iFit to get the most out of the treadmill, and the membership costs $100 for the year.  I find the pre-programmed workouts to be exceedingly difficult as another reviewer noted.  Sure you could just adjust the program to meet your ability level every single minute, but then how is this different than creating a program manually?  I'm not even certain it is even possible to save custom workouts if you wanted to, as other machines allow you to do.

Also if you happen to get a sword belt to go with it that goes across your back, it will be near impossible to get it out the way Link does in the games because of the length of the sword, but that's unrealistic video games for you.Overall this sword is amazing and is very reasonably priced and you should definitely buy it.Oh and only the tip is sharp the rest of the sword is not actually sharpened"

I do not encourage anyone trying to lessen or remove the weights in the zipper by the way (reading some other reviews - opinion).   Some people might have the nerve to wash weighted equipment, and remove the weights etc...I don't and if you don't with these either, you might see the benefit. The material would likely wear out quicker...simply let them air out or spray em and air out till next day (but be warned these gloves, of all workout weighted equipment I've owned STINK worse than anything!) Don't let them sit in a gym bag and keep them air'ed or away from an enclosed small area...  For the price, these are a bargain and you cannot find half finger weighted gloves like these at any greater weight (nor would you likely need to). I like them because I can actually grip things unlike with some other weighted gloves, the Atlus fingerless/half finger are good to move around in and workout with.  I'm giving this a 5 star rating (it probably deserves a 4 honest) for reasons above but 5 because the fact is I've searched quite a bit and you won;t find better weighted glove especially at a price like this. Good investment for those of you who work out with weighted equipment. Durable and velcro strap isn't garbage in my opinion. Holds well.  Hope this helps you.  By the way, I'm a big guy and small/med fit snug and fine. Measure correctly, I was lucky I got to try em on before buying since they were shelved at store"

Oh, wait, that sounds kind of dirty...","I bought these from an Amazon retailer but on my wife's account (she had a gift certificate she didn't want to use, so I did).  They're a bit lighter weight and not as high an attenuation factor as the heavier grade ones, but still sufficient on their own in the indoor range unless the guy next to you starts firing hot 45ACP loads.  I tend to wear the foam in-canal compressible protectors beneath muffs anyway, and with them these are quite sufficient.They do fold up nice and compact, and despite being rather smallish in the bag, they do totally cover (as in outline) my ears, rather than 'squishing' your upper or lower lobes painfully back (in my case, into the bows of my glasses).  Definite extra credit for the complete circumaural sizing.  The top band has good tension but not so much that these will give you headaches.You do have to 'un-adjust' them at the wires every time to get them to flip over and fold up, but that's a minor issue and well worth the nice compact stowage capability.4 stars only because they're not QUITE enough on their own in all conditions, but that might not be entirely fair - I did intentionally buy a *lightweight* product vs. a 'full sound reduction' product.

I really loved the idea of incorporating Google maps & was glad to see that there were EIGHTEEN workout apps! HA!First, if you want to use this product to the fullest of its capabilities, you have to purchase an additional $100 item & then pay for a monthly or annual subscription to continue using it after one year. The service itself is patchy & unreliable. If you elect not to make this purchase, say goodbye to all of the perks like Google maps, iFit Live, & customized/personalized workouts. But there are still 18 workout options, right? WRONG. The ""workouts"" are the same, incredibly simplistic workouts with miniscule changes.

I used to work as a mechanic, I am mechanically inclined & detail-oriented. I followed the directions exactly. I had no problems & no noises.

I have to take apart the front end to try to remedy this & frankly I wish I'd never wasted my money on this piece of crap.

It spends most of its life nestled in my cargo pocket or wreaking havoc on loose screws, bolts, and unopened packages. I have touted the benefits to many of my friends and several have purchased this multi-tool. It does a wonderful job and I am glad to have had such a capable and good looking tool but upon somber reflection I have realized that there may be better tools out there now. What made me question my favorite multi-tool? It was a woman and a cheap bottle of wine. It all started on a cold, rainy evening... Today's wine bottles have moved largely to synthetic corks which are far more difficult to remove than real cork. If you use the corkscrew on the synthetic stoppers in conjunction with the lifter it will result in chipped glass on the spout. If you use the corkscrew without the lifter you will just look like an idiot who does not know how to open a bottle of wine. Even some of the dedicated tools used by wine servers are now antiquated due to the increased friction of modern synthetic corks. So unless you find a bottle with the real cork, the corkscrew on the CS4 is not particularly useful. And since I have no plans on relinquishing my cheap wine it would seem that the corkscrew on my CS4 has now become the appendix of my multi-tool. More annoying than the corkscrew is that the flat blade screwdrivers of the CS4 are excessively difficult to retrieve. They have small retrieval grooves for grasping and I find that I almost always cut the top knuckle of whichever finger I use to pry out the screwdriver blade. I say pry because I sometimes need a second tool (keys/coin) to fish them out. This is not a good design.ConclusionThough I have been pleased with its performance, if I lost my CS4 it would be replaced by something else. I believe that it would be replaced by either the Leatherman Skelitool or the Gerber Crucial. Both of have screwdrivers, pliers, a knife,(my most used tools) are half an ounce lighter, and neither of them have a corkscrew. They do lack the wood saw and the scissors. They do however have locking blades (a feature that I would greatly appreciate), and have a removable pocket/belt clips. Though the Crucial looks better, the winner in my mind is the Skelitool because it has replaceable bit drivers giving it more versatility and reducing the worries about using the flathead as a pry tool. If you love the form factor or the vibrant colors the Juice series, the S2 is a nice choice. It omits the corkscrew and the wood saw but shaves an ounce in the process. It also comes in a nice, easy to see if dropped, orange color.Pros-Nice tool selection-Compact form-Only 5.5 ounces-Construction seems goodCons-Blade does not lock-Corkscrew does not work on synthetic corks-Flathead drivers difficult to retrieveBottom lineA low four stars. I like this multi-tool but I feel that there are better options in the 5oz market such as the Skelitool or the Juice S2.screwdrivers, pliers, a knife,(my most used tools) are half an ounce lighter, and neither of them have a corkscrew.

I also noticed that the rear sight doesn't stay completely flat when folded down, but again not something I'm worried about at this price point.All in all, they work for what I intended them to do, and the price was right.

Blade has a decent belly, sharp but somewhat delicate tip and clipped for an abrupt edge which aids in a back cut. Aluminum pommel makes a great non-lethal self defense option.Things I didn't like: The pocket clip on mine had to be adjusted as the tension was too strong, making it difficult for me to clip the knife into my pocket or take it out. The factory relief edge was God awful! I had it backed up and re-profiled. Edge retention is much better now. I highly recommend getting that done.Again, overall, a great EDC option, especially for those with small hands"

As has been said by other reviewers, I've spent a lot more money and gotten a lot less knife.It's a bit larger than many other folding LB's I typically use for casual carry roles, but that extra bit of size and heft were a couple of the reasons why I decided to take a chance on ordering one of these in the first place. It makes for a bit of a decent handful.The grind is surprisingly even and clean, and the sharpness is perfectly acceptable.I'm comfortable with the effort required to open and close this knife, and the liner lock seems to engage cleanly and to a good degree behind the blade. The thumb studs, while large and easily grasped, aren't sharp. They look large, but don't seem to get in the way of \\""working blade\\"" availability once the blade is locked in the open position. Look like beehives, though.If every one of these models ships in the same condition, there's no reason not order extras/spares.Not a fancy knife, nor something to buy as 'pocket jewelry', but something that seems as though it'll serve for a medium-duty working LB.As long as the quality remains consistent, this ought to be a solid selling line, especially at the price being advertised through Amazon.As usual, Amazon's handling & shipping of my order was more than satisfactory"

The glass is so clear it's obvious in the first minute this is a quality product.  The mount is rock solid, and the adjustments are positive and easy to make.  I wish they were 1/4 MOA, but one can only get so much.  I especially like that the reticle is so bright, without batteries.  Truly a tough piece of gear.  The scope coat is a pain to use, but nevertheless keeps the unit clean and scratch free.  I'll consider getting scope caps.  I have it mounted on an AR-15 and it is MADE for this rifle.  And yes, you CAN look through it with both eyes open--it is made for that, and performs well as advertised.On the other hand, concerning the seller, Gun Holsters Unlimited:  they are unreliable at best. I paid for two day shipping, and it took 5 days to get to me.  That's not a big deal I know...but still, I paid extra and expected the extra service.  I left feedback and the seller (Gun Holsters Unlimited) called and told me that Amazon delayed sending them the order, and it was Amazon's fault, not their own.  She begged me to remove my feedback and she would refund my shipping costs.  Ok, that was fair, and I appreciated the call.  I removed my feedback, within an hour, but so far, weeks later, she has not refunded my shipping.  Again, monetarily not a big deal, but a promise is a promise.  So why pay more?  You won't get any faster service--shame on Gun Holsters Unlimited.  If you screw up, you should admit it...don't blame others.  And to top it all off, Art from \\""customer service\\"" at Gun Holsters Unlimited then emailed me, asking for feedback on their performance, can you believe it?  I'm still shaking my head at that one.  So I'm writing this feedback to let you all know.  I think other sellers will do fine for you...just don't use Gun Holsters Unlimited if you can help it.  I see Optics Planet is selling this now through Amazon cheaper than what I paid for it--go with them.  I know THEY are a good company.Oh well, Trijicon has themselves a winner!  I'm totally pleased with this scope.  Pricey, but worth it.  By the way, I believe this horseshoe reticle is better than the triangle--it's more clearly defined, and crystal clear.  If you look through both scopes side by side you'll see what I mean.  The horseshoe is the way to go.FIVE STARS for Trijicon!"

It is a large full size microfiber towel that I actually fold the edges of so that I can avoid it rubbing on the dirty gym floor. Because of the microfiber aspect, it as a bit more grip to my yoga mat which reduced the sliding which is great! As you're switching grip and sweating on the towel though, you can still slide around a bit. Also, the microfiber aspect is supposed to reduce bacterial buildup which is great for hot yoga classes where you get worried about fungus infections. I love the towel and would recommend it but I did have to take away a star for two reasons, 1. It still does slide around quite a bite depending on your grip and how sweaty it gets (ew, I know, but I have to mention it). 2. After I washed the towel, it tends to attract lint in the wash so it comes out with little balls of lint everywhere. I've seen this problem before with certain microfiber materials so I know its not an isolated problem, but still annoying. Otherwise, does its job and I would highly recommend this towel if you go to yoga classes, especially hot yoga"

There is person showing modified version of the exercises and I have been following  that for some parts, but have found that the more I do the less I have to do the modified version.  I have lost some weight as well as inches and notice more muscle. Another GREAT thing about T25 is that it is only 25 minutes per day which works with my busy schedule.  I recommend T25"

Amazon shipping was great, it came the day it was expected to come. But I was however not pleased with the quality of the gun. First of all, the stock is cheap plastic, and it is kind of rough, but the barrel/ trigger assembly  was qality metal except the trigger guard. Some things that make the gun a questionable buy are that it comes with ABSOLUTELY no instructions. Also the trigger guard is plastic. I was thinking it would be metal considering that everything else is. And the bolt has some lubricant on it, but you will need more because it is kind of rough when you pull it back. And this is my opinion, but the hopup is crap. It didnt do a thing . And the gun wouldnt even penetrate a can from point blank range. The only thing this gun would probably be good for is plinking cans, or shooting squirrels off the bird feeder from 20-40 feet away. All in all, this was a bad buy. One more thing i would like to point out is that i didnt listen to the bad reviews because there were so little. But please be careful and dont make the mistake of buying this gun, save your money and buy something better quality"

I usually don't write purchase reviews and I bought this product directly from Spruce Athletic, but, because the quality was so disappointing, I felt compelled to leave my comments on Amazon so that many other people can be informed about it. Spruce Athletic boasts solid, durable construction, yet the product fails to live up to its expectation. The biggest problem is the corner which broke apart on its own after our fourth or fifth game. I even went to a professional welder to see if I can fix the goal at a reasonable price and I was informed that the problem was the thin, hollow stainless metal tubing used for the corners, which was poor and weak, and it would be better for me to buy a new pair of a different brand rather than fixing the goals. If you are deciding, and until Spruce Athletic fixes this problem, I strongly suggest that you go with another brand. I am very unhappy and definitely not impressed"

It has slightly shorter handles, which doesn't bother me at all.  I doubt it would be noticeable to anyone or bother anyone unless you have crazy large man/lady hands.  Maybe the shorter handles aid in mastering double unders.  I'm not sure because I am not a master double under-er.2.  It is easily and quickly adjustable (gym ropes did not adjust at all).  If you magnify the picture there are little screws around the cable near the handles that you can loosen, then slide down the cable to wherever you want.  Then tighten the screw.  It does leave excess, but you can clip it if it bothers you (then put the little rubber cap thing on your new end).  I couldn't bring myself to clip it because it works for two people turning the rope and a 3rd person (child) jumping.  We spent an hour playing with it when it came.So, basically, all I wanted was a cable rope to function as well as the one I had experienced at my gym and this performs just as I expected"

So far, it has met my expectations without fail.  I didn't have any of the problems with adjusting the rope length.  I'm 6' tall and needed to remove a good 6\\"" or so to achieve the correct length.  The end caps of both handles were removed easily and the rope could be pushed through the ends of the handles without difficulty.  I trimmed the end, replaced the locking ferrule and am now good to go.  The rope turns easily and works well.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the rope seems to get chewed up pretty easily when using it on the road, but this hasn't adversely affected the usability of the jump rope.  I'll just have to see how it holds up after more abuse.  Overall, I'm quite pleased with this purchase"

But now, I have a broken GPS/phone mount.The design is cool, useful and very adaptable but the longevity and durability is in question for me. One additional plus; it looks like they've updated the mounting bracket. The old one (mine) was a cumbersome 2 piece \\""hook here, screw there\\"" type of design.

I felt that the grip held up great indoors and outdoors, even on wet surfaces. The break-in period was pretty quick.Bounce- The Neverflat internal bladder gives it an off sound, so it'll be a slight adjustment for more astute players listening to ball movement. I play on weekends and after two years, it lost enough air that I had to pull the rubber covering on the airhole off with needle nose pliers. I used a bike pump to get it up to full again and it lasted about another year. I felt that was exceptional inflation duration.Durability- The first year, the grip and cover stayed true (fall-spring) for a mix of indoor/outdoor use. Once I got to summer, where I played more outdoors on rough concrete, the cover started wearing off very quickly, causing the ball to go from a bright brown-orange to a dull orange. By the 2nd year, the leathery color gave away to a dull orange as more wear and tear ate away most of the pebbling. Third year it was nothing more than an outdoor practice ball.Overall- I think this is a solid, durable ball for indoor play. It loses a star for poor outdoor durability. For outdoor play, you may be better off looking at the outdoor version [[ASIN:B000PH8B7W Spalding Never Flat Outdoor Official Size Basketball]] or some of the tougher Wilsons Phenoms, like the [[ASIN:B00GV72LHQ Wilson NCAA Phenom Basketball]].For the record, I have a [[ASIN:B0009LM9B8 Wilson Evolution Game Ball Basketball]] and love it for indoor use"

When I saw the infomercial on tv,I knew this was perfect for her since it also covers the cardio workout as well. However, there is a warning I'd like to make as I give this product a 5 out of 5 stars: I have been told by her that this is no product for beginners, the workouts are somewhat intense and if you've been innactive for a long period of time, you should first do some mild cardiovascular exercise like walking for a couple of months, four times a week, and work yourself up to walking briskly for 45 minutes. After that I would recommend starting with the short version of the workouts, and only when you feel fit enough you should go with the full length version of this workout.   Eventhough I haven't actually used this product, the previous recommendations are based on my own experience in becoming fit, through different cardiovascular exercises and weight training. I couldn't even run for 12 minutes when I began, now I can run for up to an hour, or even distances of 4.5 miles, which is a great improvement of me, your typical EX couch potato.

Usually, when firing over 500-1000 rounds during training or live fire practice. I use the Hogue on my S&W model 6906 and 5906 and they will last you a lifetime as long as you do not subject them to harsh cleaning fluids and maintain them by occasionally taking them off (usually once a year) and washing them in just mild dish washing soap and warm water. After they dry I usually apply a protective coat of ArmorAll(the one for the interior), and that keeps them looking and feeling brand new until time to thoroughly do it again, which is usually one year for me. That will vary from shooter to shooter depending on how much use you put them through. I've seen people put a set of rubber grips on a firearm and place the firearm in an unprotected environment like a drawer, or end table drawer and then when they return to the firearm (years later) they find rubber rot or breakdown of the grips. This is rare though and usually happens when the firearm is only exposed to extreme heat, humidity or cold. Hogue, Uncle Mike's and Pachmayr are all superior grips, just to name a few. They are very cost efficient and will add comfort to your shooting routine. I especially like mine on my 6906's of which I have four and all have Hogue rubber grips. Buy the Hogue's - they are the best bang for your buck especially for the Smith & Wesson 2nd & 3rd generation of semi-auto pistols.

It is well made and lightweight, but no instructions are included and for this reason I gave it 4 stars.  You may want to check out some Youtube videos to see how several types of quad rails are installed.  Due to the various types of AK variants, in my case, a WASR 10/63 it took two attempts to make it fit, but once on it is solidly on and allows good grip surface and some bulk on the fore end.  The 12 caps are nice, but on my rifle the top row interfers with the light of sight for the iron sights.  You can use it for a bulkier grip and other accessories, but not for optics as you have to take off the upper hand guard to access the gas tube which may misalign your zero.  It makes the rifle much more attractive.If you have a side rail use it for your optics as there are several choices for this purpose, but for accessories such as lights, lasers, etc. this rail will do just fine.You will need several things to complete the installation:Patiencea torpedo levelblue lock tite thread blockerA dremel tool or a file as some fitting may need to take place around the gas tube area especially near the rear sight.You will need to remove both the upper hand guard and lower hand guard.  Videos are available on line to show you how to this and its not that difficult.Once you have removed the hand guards you will need to use a gun vice to level the rifle (use the torpedo level) and then take the lower hand guard with the two shims which go on each end and place it under the rifle barrel.  Once in place and the rifle is confirmed as leveled then you will do the same for the lower hand guard.  Once leveled then lock back into place the hand guard clamp.  Check the level again.  If off center then remove the hand guard band via the clamp on the right hand side and loose it up until you can move the piece level.  You may have to repeat this process until it islevel otherwise it will install incorrectly, or not all.Once leveled then you may then take the gas tube and install it and lock it into place.  The upper hand guard piece and place it on the gas tube and check for fit. Align the screw holes tops and bottoms and check to make sure that the gas tube is not pinched.  Then use blue lock tite on the screws and carefully thread the screws onto the hand guards and do not over tight.  Cycle the bolt carrier back every so often.If it catches you have over tighten and will need to back off the screws a few turns each. Let the thread block dry for 24 hours and you have completed the install successfully.I hope this helps you with the installation and the videos on line"

Pros: Zippo guarantee, natural vintage look, very durable (I've dropped it many times on solid concrete and it hardly puts a dent on it, it's also been through the washing machine and worked fine after I dried out the cotton).    Cons: Lighter fluid evaporates quickly, as it does with all zippos, Zippo fluid, flints, and wicks only, (I used a non-zippo flint and it wore down my flint-wheel so I had to replace it) leaves your pants smelling like lighter fluid, and lastly don't drop it while lit"

Now with that out of the way i reacentlly batoned with the knife and it did great i did feel some vibrations because of the grivory scales but you can either buy the micarta ones ( recommend you do so) or you can wrap the handle with paracord. The handle fits well in my hand, out of all my knives this one fits the best. It came shaving sharp right out of the box and after i was done batoning it was still sharp enough for me to do some carving, as well as feather sticks. I like the knife and will buy the micarta scales for it since ka-bar doesn't seem to check places about their customer's feed back or else they would just include them with the knives. I will also be making some modifications to the knife and probably buying a kydex sheath for it. If you want a good knife that you can pass down through your family for years and get it for a good price the becker knives are great. If you buy this knife you will be happy, I sure am. I will recommend that if your buying this for bushcraft work it can be difficult to do the finer things so pair it with a mora or maybe the bk neck knife.Update 7/23/12 as of now i have made some modifications to my bk 7. One i have added a finger choil which has allowed me better control for the finer bushcrafting work. The second is i have added grooves to the scales and it has provided a better grip. I have also added some velcro patches to my sheath cause the one i have had velcro attached behind the snap closure. Now it isn't a fight to close it around the handle be cause its a different type of velcro (trust me its kinda hard to explain just know it works). I have also decided that instead of buying the micarta scales i am just going to make some myself and replace the screws with pins for a much better feel. Still a great knife"

Go to YouTube and search \\""lmf ii best survival knife\\"" - Enjoy!So what makes a great survival knife? Durability? Versatility? Craftsmanship? Value? Well for around $70, the Gerber LMF II is all of the above and has become one of the most popular survival knives for those who want a serious knife that they can rely on in a pinch.VersatilityUp to almost any survival task that you could expect from a knife, the Gerber LMF II was designed to excel on the battlefield in the campground, on a hunting excursion, in an emergency or around the shop.SizeEvery LMF II has a 4.84 inch blade which is considered a medium-sized survival knife. Medium blades of 4 to 6 inches are the most popular. This knife lands almost in the middle. It's not too large for gutting and skinning medium and large game, nor is it too small for some serious bushcraft.At 10.59 inches in length and a weight of 11.67 ounces this knife is a bit heavy if you want to carry it every day on your belt. But then again, the weight is pretty easy to take when you realize that this knife is build for a lifetime of serious use. The weight is the tradeoff for a durable knife of this caliber.BladeThe Gerber LMF II sports a high-quality drop-point blade.Sloping from on the back of the blade from the handle to the tip, makes this blade extra strong over it's entire surface.Every Gerber LMF II blade is made of 420HC stainless steel that is blackened to ensure that it remains stealth in any covert operation.The knife holds an edge well and sharpens easily even following heavy use.Regardless of the situation you find yourself in this blade is going to serve you well.An additional bonus of this blade is it's serration near the handle. The serration extends the catting capabilities of the blade to slicking through tough materials like wire, wood,drywall, plastic pipe and more.Every LMF II blade has a tough non-reflective black coating to limit the attention it might otherwise draw in an covert situation.HandleThe surprisingly sturdy, nylon, glass filled handle is entombed in a TPV molded grip. The TPV grip is comfortable and has a sturdy, rubberized feel. Blisters are rare even with extended use.Gerber did a great job with this handle in that it absorbs shock well whether hammering, cutting or chopping. The handle is also designed to insulate the user from electric shock in the event that a \\""live\\"" wire need to be severed.Another great thought was the inclusion of three holes for lashing the knife to a branch or pole with some parachute cord.When tied well, this knife is transformed into a very capable and trustworthy spear.This handle is not round but comfortably thin which seems to make if feel better in the hand, increase grip while also providing a stable platform for secure lashing.One more thing about this great handle and I promise to move on.Gerber provided a heavy, pointed, stainless steal butt to this handle that is designed to break glass, in the event that going through glass in a car, plane or home is your best way of entry or escape. The butt also makes a suitable hammer and could also do some damage in a combat situation.SheathThe low-profile sheath is made of ballistic nylon and includes a useful knife sharpener which owners report works quite well.The sheath also sports a fire-resistant coating for added durability in a pinch.The knife is held in the sheath firmly with two quality straps with nice snaps.CarryingTwo leg straps come with this knife. The sheath is also designed to strap onto just about any waist belt and attaches nicely to a Molle vest.ProsIt's very difficult to find a bad review on this knife. Owners report extreme satisfaction in general for it's durability, construction, look, feel, grip and general versatility. This is a well constructed, well designed and quality built knife that should last a lifetime with minimal care.ConsThe knife and sheath are a bit on the heavy side for carrying for long periods, especially on a belt. You probably won't notice the weight if you strap this knife to your pack.ConclusionThe Gerber LMF II is an excellent choice for any situation where a manly knife may come in handy. Whether you ever use it to keep yourself alive or not, it's a quality tool that can provide some peace-of-mind for the unknown future that we all face.Check out my full Gerber LMF II Video Review on YouTube.

I found this product elsewhere for about $5 (no longer available) and decided to try it out. I got through about 30 days and had to take a week off because of travelling.  Afterwards, I restarted and now am on about day 40.  At this point, I have used each DVD, and I think that these are a great workout.  Have I lost a bunch of weight?  NO.  Have I followed the diet plan?  NO.  Do I sweat my (your  favorite anatomical expletive here) off during every workout?  YES.  If you want to lose weight, I think that this will work if you follow the diet plan (or pretty much any diet plan that reduces calories).  Equipment that you will need:  Dumbbells (I recommend that you have at least two sets of these.  Start with one set that you would use for  lateral raises and a second set that are about 5 pounds heavier).  Stability ball (65cm).  Other recommendations:  About one week before you plan to start this program, go ahead and try \\""Tabata Inferno\\"" [if you are not already in great shape, this workout will kick your (favorite anatomical expletive); you will need the week to recover].  Drink water, have fun"

It's a less expensive alternative compared to inzer.No rust on my lever as another shopper experienced. Smells like leather. i have pants as small as 28 and up to 30 but have a belly so i went with a belt size small. the belt size window was nice. Adjusting the screws is a little hard as the screws don't go in flush with the plate. I rolled the belt before using it to break it in. The support I felt compared to a Velcro belt I was using was day and night. I did get bruised in certain spots around my stomach the 1st time using the belt. It felt great on squats and overhead press. On deadlifts you have to find the right positioning for it. I have been using it for close to 3 months 3 times a week on the stronglift program and its held up. It does have a liftinglarge patch stitched on the inside. also just incase you don't know you do need a screwdriver to set up and adjust the lever.So in conclusions its a nice cheaper alternative to the popular inzer belt

31814765,R2OSV33K3WDZU2,B00178CS4K,841919130,SE KHK6320 Outdoor Tanto Knife with Fire Starter,Sports,4.0,0.0,0.0,Honest review on a great purchase!,"This is a great purchase! The knife itself is a full tang stainless steel blade. The fire starter is a pretty standard magnesium coated fire starter. It works just fine if you know how to use it. The sheath is soft and will need some plastic or leather inside to keep the knife from tearing it up eventually, but hey you're paying $7 here!Some of the reviews on here are just nuts. This is a $7 knife and it's worth the purchase just for the fire starter alone.Yes the knife feels like it's made from 420A stainless which is some of the cheapest steel that's used in knives these days but it's also one of the most rust resistant steels commonly available. Buy a small sharpener like the Smiths and stick it in the holster or run the lanyard through the keychain hole and you'll never have a problem with it. You'll eventually need to sharpen ANY knife in a survival situation anyway. Even a really nice knife will start to dull when shaving bark and cutting up sticks for tinder.It's a softer blade so it sharpens up with just a few passes, and holds an edge plenty good enough for cutting rope, string, shaving tinder etc. and you don't have to feel bad about using it for a tent stake in a pinch either. Just clean it and sharpen it back up after.The fire starter works great, those complaining about it obviously have never used anything but gasoline and a BIC to start a fire. The black coating is supposed to be scraped into a thumb size pile in the middle of your tinder. You won't throw a good spark until you scrape the coating off of one side of it with the knife.Put the knife as close to the tinder as you can without knocking it over, put the fire starter against any sharp flat corner of the knife with the smaller end of the fire steel pointing towards the tinder and keeping the knife still, pull the fire starter across it towards you as hard and quickly as you can without breaking it or cutting yourself. Once the tinderflames up slowly build your fire up with more small additions of tinder and build up slowly to kindling or you'll smother it.The carbide blade in the little pocket sharpeners throw a great spark, and the fire starter doesn't go down into the groove deep enough to touch the parts that scrape the blade. It will take patience and practice but anything short of a diesel-can and a match always does.Yes the rope wrapping it isn't paracord. But guess what? If that's something you actually care about, you've probably got some lying around the house anyway. It's easy to rewrap. Its got some holes bored in strategic places so you can make nice tight knots.In a survival situation the rope is plenty strong and long enough to pull the threads apart and tie branches together for a lean to, or to use to secure the knife to a long branch or small tree and make a spear. Would 550 cord be better? Yes. So if it matters that much replace it. If u don't have any it's  $5 for 100 feet on this site.My only complaint about this knife is the sheath. It's so soft the knife will cut through it just from putting it in and out of the sheath during day to day use. I took a piece of hard clear plastic like the retail stores pack electronics in these days, cut it to size, folded it in half and pushed it down into the sheath. The knife slides along the plastic and doesn't cut into the sheath. You do have to bear down on the Velcro strap pretty hard to make sure it doesn't slide out though.It's a simple dirty fix but it wouldn't be that much more money for them to line the inside with hard plastic so this wouldn't be a problem.Behind my piece of plastic I have a ziploc bag with some lint and dried out tinder in it.So in short:$7 knife and fire starter$8 smiths pocket sharpenerPiece of hard plasticZiploc bag with small bit of tinder in itAnd you have the beginnings of a great little pocket survival kit.You ought to buy 2 or 3 of these so you can practice with the fire steel and still have one untouched for yor kit. They're so cheap! Why not?!"

I wasn't expecting them for a week or more.Although Carlisle is not a brand I'm familiar with, these 12\\"", 4-hole wheels were a perfect fit for my 1987 Starcraft tent trailer and installed quickly and easily. The wheels are sturdy steel stock, nicely painted white, and the rubber seems to be of good quality. Including the tires, they measure a little over 21\\"" in diameter.Price had gone up quite a bit since the last time I bought a trailer tire (10 years ago), but after shopping around, I found this price turned out to be pretty good.Caution: be sure to know your weight requirements. I *almost* purchased a set that turned out to be narrower, and only rated at about 750 pounds per tire. That would not have been acceptable. Even a small trailer with gear weighs close to 2,000 pounds. Also be sure you need the FOUR HOLE wheel. There are a lot more 5-hole wheels out there.Anyway - good experience. If these are what you're shopping for, I heartily recommend them"

Despite plenty of recommendations from friends, I bought the VTAC rail, and it does indeed wobble a little bit.  even by bridging the handguard rail and mounting my optic a little farther forward than i'd like, the wobble still persists.  Unless I can find a fix very soon, I will most likely stick this one back in the box, or give it to a friend, and go with my first option for a handguard: The Samson Evolution.  I have run Samson MFG handguards before and they have absolutely ZERO wobble, with or without anything mounted on them.  While I have always been impressed with the quality of Troy Industries, the VTAC alpha rail leaves a little to be desired.Pros: Lightweight, Small Diameter, 13"" gives plenty of space for EOtech, magnifier, back up sights, and lighting.Cons: Wobbles a few degrees to the left, 1 o clock and 11 o clock rail slots are essentially useless for mounting anything, as the rails will actually touch the upper rail.  only 3, 6, and 9 rail slots are useable.If anyone has a fix for the wobble, please comment below and I will update my review and rating"

Knowing the exact distance to the pin makes evaluation of your club selection more accurate which in turm helps you get the right club next time.When mine was lost in a lake after a cart accident in Nevada, I looked at the models available in the US golf shops and was pleased to see the Lengthmaster was now available from Amazon. It is a 7x zoom and that alone puts it ahead of most of its similarly priced competitors.It has a continuous scanning mode and I find sweeping across the flag will give you the distance if you find it too hard to hold it steady. It will display in yards or metres and the latter was important to me since it saved me mentally converting yards from sprinkler markers which I had to do while I waited to get the replacement.Like other rangefinders, this allows you not only to get the distance to the pin but also to the front or back of water or sand or inded anything you can see. This helps work out whether you need to lay up on doglegs.I played 17 different courses in my 6 week trip and having this aid helps compensate for lack of local knowlegde on a course. Unlike a GPS system there was no need to download new course details each time"

Legibillity is also excellent, the large dial and dark numerals against a very light background are easily legible, as are the day and date.

It's a great mug because it's the only one I've found of it's type-- \\""tall\\"" size rather than \\""venti\\"" makes it a more realistic size for those of us who only drink one cup of coffee or hot tea on the way into work.  It's designed to fit well in car cup holders and because it's not top heavy, it doesn't knock over easily.  It fits great in your hand and never feels too hot.  The inside is metal rather than plastic.  The lid seals well, too.  The sip cover piece slips a little bit from the steam, and some mugs keep hot liquids warm longer, but those are the only slight down sides.  It also is hand wash only, but that likely goes for any travel mug.  I can't find another mug like it in any store-- they all seem to be so huge, top heavy, and have a handle.  The only downside to ordering this item was I didn't get to pick the color.  I assumed it was just bright blue, but received a dark silver.  My husband actually liked the silver color better so it worked out.  If you want a color selection, you could email the seller.  They were really quick to respond to a question I had"

I don't know how often I am disapointed by regular balls that don't bounce and don't last and are simply dead specially against the wall. The Tretorn balls are lively have a fun bounce and are incredibly long lasting. They are fun against the wall and fun on the tennis court. Finding these balls have really revitalized my tennis experience. The waste I avoid using these balls  is not to be believed. I did buy the Penn pressurless and find them not nearly as much fun at the wall. They  simply don't deliver the fun that the Tretorns do for me. The Penn's still play fine at the tennis court and are fun at the tennis court more so than the regular pressurized balls.  However the Tretorns are best all around and in the future will be the ONLY ball in my bag. In a pinch  It's good to know Penn has a good product. However Tretorns are more fun for me and they get my vote

Tennis elbow is the second most common golf injury and the new term for the condition is now called \\""Tennis / Golf Elbow\\"".This product is a \\""Tennis / Golf Elbow Strap With EVA pad\\"" which is basically a specialised strap which applies pressure on your elbow with the intention of improving joint function efficiency and relieving strain. I have seen a lot of these type of products over the years and it's not difficult to separate the good from the bad - this is very good in both quality and design.It's made of a combination of nylon (35%), spandex (25%), cotton (25%), rubber (15%) and these materials as a whole provide you with comfort, compression, flexibility and warmth which create the ideal conditions for improved joint function, strain relief and recovery. Once you have reviewed the instructions on the Amazon product page you will find that it's easy to apply and very comfortable to wear. It held in position very well indeed and did not cause any skin related problems or pain. It reminded me a lot of the arm cuff that doctors / physicians use to measure your blood pressure.Your doctor / physician / sports injury specialist will be able to tell you where to specifically place the thick inner rubber pad and at what tightness setting the strap needs to be. I usually accurately mark both points with a marker pen because it's impossible to remember where to put it (accurately) once you have taken it off for showering etc"

They absolutely love it.  I chose this design because it appeared they could both be on it together, although it is not recommended, and at this stage, that is true.  My son is much larger than his sister, and he was able to jump much higher and harder...so much so that the back legs would come off the ground.  Never so much so that I thought it would tip over, but it got quite loud.  They also loved to swing on the handle and found many creative ways to be silly with the 'jumpy,' as we call it.  Unfortunately, my son got more and more daring in less than 2 months.  He ended up using the handle to support himself up in the air after he jumped and ended up flipping over the bar! It was quite terrifying...but he was okay...just frightened.  We debated getting rid of it entirely, but ended up just removing the handle.  So far so good, although they don't have nearly as much fun with it.  Also, the plastic that covers the springs ripped in two corners.  The manufacturer was very timely in sending out a replacement, free of charge.  I'm not sure if we put it on too tightly, but I am worried that it will happen again.  A benefit of the cover is that it has the alphabet on it.  My kids have become very good at recognizing letters because of it"

I started out just a little past horizontal - did that for a week or two.  Then lowered it a bit more each week.  I was not able to go very far at first - it's recommended that you work up to full inversion slowly.  Some may be able to handle more than I did at first but I would feel funny if I went too far too soon.  It was a feeling like my lips were ""asleep"" and tingling so I went back to a slow and steady pace; I am now at full inversion and it feels really good.

The AIM M4 rail is priced right and is built very well. It adds about 12 to 14 oz, but given that you are probably taking off the factory hand guard, your mileage will differ. On one install it fit right in and that's all there was to it, on another I had trouble getting the alignment just right and had to modify it a bit, seems the tabs on the rail were not lining up related to the big gear thing on the gun. Enter the dermal. I ground down the tabs that were in the way on the rail and it fit fine. (Use safety glasses, no joke.)  Big tip here, to pull that spring loaded base down, a major pain by hand, use a rubber coated handle pliers or you could buy the special tool made for it, either way makes that part tons easier. You will know when it is right or wrong, no middle ground here. Once installed it will accommodate any add on you want from lasers to lights to hand grips or red dots.

41135715,R12J5TGCS5UWKA,B00IX5LHNS,281088118,Graced By Grit Kick Your Butt Short,Sports,5.0,0.0,0.0,"Style, Comfort, and Quality","There are cheaper running shorts out there. However, over the years, I've learned you get what you pay for. Running shorts made by high-end brands (including major running apparel brands) are at the same (or higher) price point. The good stuff costs a little bit more, but you don't have to replace it as often. You know it's true if you've been buying fitness apparel for a few years.These shorts feature a couple of seemingly small details that set them apart from other brands. Of course the cut is really cute and comfortable. Those are two areas where women's running shorts should never fall short, and the Kick Your Butt Shorts score high marks in both categories. The extra details put them over the top. The liner brief is a high-quality mesh, so it's very breathable. I put in a lot of miles during the summer months, and I know that's going to make a difference. The other detail I love is that they're cut a little bit longer on the inner part of the legs. If you've ever run a long distance, you know that thigh chafe is real. Adding a little bit of extra material in that area helps diminish the thigh rub problem some of us face (yes, I could run in capris, but I prefer to run/race in shorts). These shorts come in a flattering cut and are made of quality materials. I'd like to see these shorts in some other colors - perhaps take a nod from the kickers or tanks"

Push type repair tools will not do this if used properly. All you do is push the short tines into the ground around the outside of the ball mark. This pushes the edges of the ballmark together without damaging the grass.  Then just tap down the mark  No twisting or pulling needed.This is the best method to repair ball marks.

Several times a month I feel so wound up with my shoulders being hard as a rock that it causes me actual tension headaches and keeps me keyed up which in turn wrecks my moods and affects my ability  to unwind before bed which in turn destroys the possibility of any good night's sleep which we all need! I have tried everything including actually muscle relaxer medication. I have tried Yoga and Pilates which I love but also which are too much of a time consuming bother whe I need fast relief and DO NOT FEEL like spending excessive time to get it. As for massage therapy, my muscles are so hard and tight that even a 30 minute deep tissue massage won't even loosen them up enough to give me some amount of relief. But who wants to bother with that too? Plus, not everone has the luxury of spending lots of $$$'s on massages or pestering people to give them one several times a week!Soo, anyhow here is my review - I just received this item today and right out of package I lay on the floor with it under my mid-shoulders and had a nice roll up and down my back for several minutes. I ordered the 6 x 36 and I was very impressed with the extra firm density (I am 5'9 and 143lbs, Female). The relief was pretty much instant because this roller is so firm and has to be to really get down to business, and it does! About 10 minutes after I'd stopped I felt so loose and my brain was buzzing with good vibes (Endorphins, I suppose) and not to be silly but, I think I can see my aura! HahaIf you suffer from stress and tension that strikes randomly and messes up your day AND you don't feel like putting in much effort to feel normal again then BUY THIS, it's worth it!"

After I had my kids, I struggled to find a workout program that I could stick with.  I tried several of the ones on the market.  I didn't stick with any of them for various reasons: (1) the workouts were too lengthy; (2) the programs were too restrictive and required workouts on a daily basis; and/or (3) the workouts were either too challenging for someone who just had a baby (all the jumping, not so fun for new mamas!) or not challenging enough for someone who enjoyed a pretty high level of fitness pre-kids.  Tough balance there.  Fe fit has been great and fits the bill for those who want short yet very challenging workouts.I love the variety -- you get 4 different workouts for each genre, and there are about 7 genres.  (If you break it down per workout, the cost is quite reasonable especially when compared to other workout programs on the market.)  You get a really tough workout in 30 minutes.  If you have more than 30 minutes, you can throw on a second workout.  I rarely do this because I'm so tired from the first workout.  The kit comes with workout plans that allow for flexibility.  For example, on the 3-day a week plan, you can do Fe Fit workouts 3 days a week and then do some other activity of your choice (or none at all) on the other days.  Running after your kids at the park counts.  When I wake up and have no idea what sort of workout I'm going to do that day, or just feel too tired, I throw on a Fe Fit workout and at least I get that 30 minutes in.  Anything else that day is a bonus.Fe Fit has really changed the way I view working out post-kids.  I don't have to spend 90 minutes at the gym everyday.  That is unrealistic and at this point, not so fun.  These workouts are challenging, effective, time efficient, and fun.  I can wait for more workouts from Fe Fit!"

Let me explain. My left foot is a size 9 and my right on a size 9.5 in American female sizes. These shoes are not really sized in male or female and I wasn't sure what size to get. I got some advice and opted for a size 42. These shoes run small by about a size and there are no half sizes as far as I can tell. So my left shoe felt awfully loose and the right one slightly loose. But, I love the fact the shoes are wide. I have a wide foot and these felt great in the toe box and big part of my foot.I put in one of my orthopedic insoles and it seemed to pretty much take care of the problem. I'm not used to shoes being this flat and I wasn't sure if my bad knees could stand them. But so far they seem to be working ok with the shoes. They really do feel great to workout in. I get lots of movement and yet good traction.I suggest you buy one size larger than the size you normally buy and if you wear a half size, you may need to go up two sizes. Also, if you have really narrow feet, you may not like the shoes. But, if your feet are wide or even close to wide, you'll likely love the room in the shoe.Truth be told, shoes are very subjective and what feels wonderful to one person may totally be miserable on another person. So, I'm hesitant to either condemn or recommend these shoes to you. But they're highly recommended by almost all monks and martial artists.If you order from The Martial Arts Store, expect three or four days to pass before they ship. But, when they finally ship, they ship overnight. At least they did mine. There are other online stores that would be better to buy from who ship within 24 hours.-- Susanna K. Hutcheson"

The nighttime photos are fairly grainy and a bit noisy when enlarged, but, hell, it's taking photos in the dark without flash and you can ID the animals.  Using the Field Scan option at night is not as effective as it's difficult to see anything clearly that isn't in the immediate range.  Animals in motion can be a bit blurry. The only problem we've had so far is when we were working it too much (Field Scan on for several hours, every minute) we would get \\""Unrecognized format\\"" or similar messages on some of the frames.The camera has gotten quite hot at times and has weathered quite a bit of rain without issue after daily use for a month.  We used 8 Energizer lithium batteries as recommended by the manufacturer for the first 2 or 3 weeks.  These were supposed to last a year(!), but we did use the camera a lot, on the highest settings and also tried some video.  Have switched to rechargeable batteries which work great for us.  Haven't really gotten into the video feature so far, but seems to work fine.Oh - one more thing.  Not sure why they call this model \\""brown\\"" as you can see from the photo that it is black.  Not an issue for our use"

My car has a heavy throttle and wearing steel-toed boots was an extreme pain to drive in during Chicago rush hour traffic. So I was looking for a good, light-weight boot that wasn't super expensive. I then came upon these.I read good reviews on them, and the price was right, so I decided to buy them. When they came in I tried them on immediately and discovered they fit almost perfectly. I wear between a size 13-14 depending on how wide the shoe is, and I ordered a size 13. My initial test-walk in my house went well and I felt they were very comfortable.The next day I decided they were good so I wore them to work. They are very warm and the leather does a good job of keeping your foot insulated. By the time I got to work, my feet were sweating. It was also during this drive that I discovered the main issue with the boots. Near my ankle bones, there is a piece that kept cutting into my ankle during the first couple days of walking in them. It left my ankles slightly scraped up, but after breaking the shoes in it either doesn't do it anymore, or I just don't notice it anymore.Once broken in, the boots are quite comfortable, and I have no issue walking in the snow in them. My only other complaint is if you have bigger calves, they may be a little tight. It isn't horrible, but sometimes it is a little difficult to fully zip up the boots.I'm happy with them so far, and hopefully I'll continue enjoying them"

The door mounts work okay, but you have to bend your knees to clear the floor and they always mess up my door frames. This is the first ceiling-mounted pull up bar I've tried. It is 48"" on center, so it was easy to mount to my 24"" joists, despite the fact that my house is over 100 years old. Installation took about 2 hours, but mostly because I had trouble locating my joists without a stud finder. Once it was up, it was solidly installed, so I didn't have to worry about it coming loose during the middle of a set. It is a bit intrusive in my guest bedroom, so I would recommend taking that into consideration when thinking about using this. The nice thing about a door mount is I can remove it when I'm done. With this, it is up there for good. It has a nice width so you can do wide pull ups, and the best thing is that I don't have to bend my knees anymore when doing pull ups. My only real complaint is that I think the bar is a little too thin for my hands and would prefer if it was a little thicker. I got around this by wrapping tennis grip around the bar"

The gun is very heavy and has almost as much weight as a real glock 17 that is unloaded. Most of the weight is in the magazine which weighs more than the gun. you can dismatle the mag and there will be a weighted metal piece inside it and will allow you to take apart the magazine. the gun was very nice and sturdy. the gun is make of high quality plastic and not gonna just break easily. The gun has a slide lock and locks automatically when your clip is empty, which is cool. you can also look into the bullet injector and you can see the inside of the gun when it is cocked. if you dont know if you have a bb in the gun and dont wanna fire it you can cock it and look down the barrel to see if you have a bb inside. You can also dissemble the gun like a real one but you need to take off the back plate which is the plate opposite of the barrel, and use the dissamble things in the middle of your gun, below the slide. the internal and slide lock are metal, comes with no markings. Very accurate. does no drop  and has a very far distance. ALSO COMES WITH ORANGE TIP, but i used a sharpie on it and it looks like a metallic black which is cool i also used a silver sharpie and gave it night sights, realy good gun get if ur looking for a quality spring gun"

There are a lot of features for this scope but they are really cheaply executed. The biggest feature I like is the rotating scope to allow you to take a shot and easily move over to the eyepiece to see where you shot.However, the eye relief is terrible and gets a lot worse the higher you zoom out. You have to move around quite a bit just to get a good sight picture. Speaking of sight picture, that's not very good either. The lack of fine focus is hard to dial in a good look and the quality of glass and coatings really lacks light transfer. In fact, It's hard to see .22 holes at 100 yards with low or overcast lighting. My 20 year $65 bushnell scope let's more light in then this 60mm objective. You can see glue or caulk sealers poorly applied while making this scope and there appears to be dust or something inside the lenses that you can see if the light is right. I would not recommend this product unless you are comparing it to a $89 barska. The $60 more you pay is worth the rotating feature so you don't have to get up away from your rifle to look where you last shot. Good luck"

Just something worth noting though,  I replaced the handles with g10 handles from an esee 5 (because it has a bow drill divot on the handle) and the hardware stripped in the process.

I purchased it in Olympia sports at the mall. It seems like an effective workout tool; and a nice/challenging supplement to my other resistance bands.However, some cons: There was a weird shipping powder all over this product, it was hard to wipe off, it got all over my clothes and made my hands feel icky....sounds 'picky' but you'll see what I mean. Another small issue was the color;; instead of a nice red color; mine was more a girlie pink in color...not a big deal; just trying to give an accurate description here. It states on the box that each red cable =30lbs peak....I don't think this is true because my purple advanced Xertube is rated at 20lbs and seems stronger to me....but all 3 engaged is definitely stronger. The handles seem awkward. The enclosed video dvd comes in a professional case, but is very cheesy. The picture and sound quality is very bad considering it was made in '09....it's just a guy in the corner of a loud, echo-ee gym. The dvd tips are good though. In the package they give you a card; for 5$ shipping they will send you an updated video........not this kid! A little bait and switch action here? Sounds like I hate this product; but I don't....I do like it a lot, although it's far from perfect. Hope this helps"

My first was the school issued Gladiator gi, which was big, felt heavy, and ended up being a backup gi after a year of service.  I moved on to a Vulkan ultralight, which I used 3-4 times a week for a year and a half.  It now has so many repair patches on it I can't use it anymore.  Great gi, but it had the jiu-jitsu cut on the sleeves which forced me to alter my ezekiel technique.I specifically wanted a more judo oriented cut gi so I could apply sleeve chokes more easily.  This fits the bill perfectly.  My first NAGA competition match in this gi at purple belt level ended with an ezekiel choke.  If you are a fan of ezekiels, this is definitely a good choice for a gi.  I'm a little over 6' tall, fight at ~185lb, and the 5 fits just right.  Although I'm at the top end for the 5, it's a legal competition fit.This gi is devoid of patches and logos, which saved me the time I spent on the Vulkan using a seam ripper to remove lots of unnecessary billboards.  The jacket construction is pretty standard.  I did have a manufacturing defect on one seam where a single outer row of stitching was undone for a few inches, but 10 seconds on a sewing machine fixed that.  When I let Piranha Gear know about the manufacturing defect, they turned every customer service knob to 11, despite the fact I didn't want to exchange the gi.I like the elastic waist and drawcord on the pants.  My other gis invariably have the standard drawcord getting bound up in the back and I end up having to untwist and manage the drawcord once in a while.  These gi pants are simple and get the job done.The overall fit is good.  If you like the tighter gi jacket sleeves that are typical for BJJ, this is not your ideal gi.  I've been using this gi for Judo and BJJ for over a month, and this gi is clearly superior to Gladiator, and in many respects, it compares very favorably to the much more expensive Vulkan Ultralight.Piranha includes a nice pamphlet that tells you exactly how to care for your gi.  They leave no stone unturned, even telling you an exact temperature range for your water to get best washing results.  The hang dry time is normal for a single weave.For a simple single weave gi, I'm very happy with this gi.  The price is great, and Piranha Gear is a trustworthy brand.  This would be an excellent first gi (it includes a white belt), but it's also a good single weave gi for more experienced BJJ players that want this particular cut"

Having said that, this is a solid piece of equipment and functions well.The minor assembly took 10 minutes which includes getting it out of the box. The mounting straps are similar to shock cord with a hook/bar latch for easy bag placement and removal. The solid wheels roll freely and with ease plus there is a brake for incline conditions. The handle features position adjustments plus there is a beverage holder and mesh storage pouch by the handle.The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is that the scorecard holder doesn't quite work right. The issue is two fold: one, there isn't quite enough clamp engagement to secure the card and the pencil holder didn't secure the pencil properly as it fell out on one occasion. Now, the card has never fallen out but I sense that could happen after continued use but clearly that's a concern and not a reality at this point. I will say that the plastic cover for the card is a great idea and a nice feature.The only other thing I would like is a storage pack for clothing layers as temperature changes that are typically featured on the more expensive carts but given the sturdy construction, I could probably rig something to the frame if need be down the line.Overall, CaddyTek is a good buy"

It really feels like your rowing a boat. And it seems to be pretty good exercise. Not as intense as the treadmill or bike, but good for an alternative. However, this piece of equipment isn't made to last, at least not without replacing some parts every so often. The plastic bushings in the main moving parts don't hold up. I finally replaced the main pivot bolt and plastic bushings with a larger bolt and brass bushings. I was able to find these parts at a local Ace Hardware. These are a lot better than the original parts.Today the shock broke where it connects to the frame. I've owned the Body Trac Glider for about a year and 4 months, so for the shock to die in that time isn't too bad considering I use it every other day for about 20 or 25 minutes (600 to 850 strokes). I just ordered a new shock, bushings for the extension arms, and 4 seat rollers. With shipping that's about a $50 order. So, if you use this every day, and more than 1 person in the family uses it, you could potentially wear out 2 shocks and 2 full sets of bushings every year, for about another $100 per year to keep it working. Considering the initial cost of about $150, that is not too terrible, but it is a hassle having to maintain it. I also have to tighten the bolts and lube it every couple months or so.This machine does make some creaking noises, especially as it gets older and the parts start wearing out a bit. That doesn't really bother me. I just pretend I'm rowing a boat, which is also a pretty creaky activity.The calorie counter is more or less meaningless as it does not change based on the shock adjustment. I would not expect that it reads too high like some counters on cheap equipment do. If anything maybe too low - but who knows!The stroke counter only goes up to 10,000, which for me is a little less than a months use. I mark it down on the machine body every time it turns over so I can track my total usage. They should have made it to go up to at least 100,000 or a million would have been better. They probably don't figure that people will actually use their equipment enough to care or notice.So, this is an OK machine if you don't mind changing some parts occasionally. Its not too expensive, so the expense over time is tolerable. Also, I expect that if you use it with the shock at about the mid adjustment point or less, the shock and some of the bushings might last a little longer - but don't know this for sure. I use mine almost at the maximum adjustment.I would recommend this product with some reservations. If only they would improve a few fairly minor quality issues this would be a great machine. Of course then they would probably charge twice as much.Note: The woman I spoke to when I ordered parts sounded like a sweet little old lady. She said she lives in Missouri, and talked like a real down home US citizen. Kind of a nice change from what you usually get"

Not what I bargained for.If you don't care about sync options, the device seems to track steps well, but it has such poor visibility and the heart rate accuracy is so lacking that I really can't recommend it.

The backlit display and motorized incline are nice bonuses to have. The only con that I can come up with is that the data tracking feature doesn't work properly.

One minute I am squatting with my hands lower on the bars, then doing moving push-ups, then gliding, then pull ups, etc. It makes for a very intense workout. If you just glide with your legs straight, you will be getting a workout but not an effective one.     This machine does not come with the video, so I you-tubed workouts and found them.

If it were a perfect world, they would come up a bit higher in the waist, though that may not be an issue if you are 6 foot or under, I would also like a bit of support or a gusseted area for male member.  That said, the fit is comfortable and keeps thing containedIf you are going to not go commando, I would suggest a thong,"

It has all the quality of the TRX at a fraction of the cost and made in the USA. I also have a TRX and I like it too, but there is no way I could justify that system when you can get this one for 40 bucks. It has solid rubber handles which are much nicer in my opinion than the foam handles on most suspension trainers. The only advantage I see on the TRX is the strap adjustments. The Woss has one extra step in the process, but still a very quick transition. If you are looking for a stable (without a pulley) suspension trainer, this is it!"
